	abstract = {Reduced-basis methods (RBMs) constitute a promising technique for delivering numerical solutions of parameterized PDEs in real time and with reasonable accuracy. The most significant drawback of RBMs is the requirement of parametric affinity, a condition that only very trivial problems satisfy. Without parametric affinity, the reduced model cannot be quickly assembled in the online stage. The most common solution to this issue is to establish a form of approximate parametric affinity. However, most methods for doing so are highly intrusive: they require in-depth expert knowledge of the problem to be solved, of the high-fidelity simulation software for solving it, or both. It is often impossible to adapt a high-fidelity software package for RBMs without significant source-code edits. We present an approach for approximate affinization based on least-squares projected quantities over a predetermined function space. We contend that this offers a method for affinization with minimal impact, which we demonstrate by producing linear elastic RBMs for components using two widely different simulation software packages, without source code edits and with no significant expert knowledge.},

Existence of a large variation in the spatio-temporal  scales in an atmospheric flow necessitates such a coupling between  different models each of which handles a particular range of scales.

            We have developed a physical room-scale porous media flow rig for operating, measuring, and visualizing reservoir flows in real time – the FluidFlower. The flow rig scale is large enough to achieve true multiphase flow effects (including phase mixture, gravity segregation and geological heterogeneities), while small enough to work on weekly time-scales, and allow for repeatable experiments.
            Mirroring the FluidFlower, we have constructed a prototype of a digital twin for porous media flow – the PoroTwin. Essentially, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve real-time transmissions of laboratory data from the FluidFlower to a cloud-based simulation- and machine learning environment, and complete the loop with applying optimal control algorithms to steer the experiment.
            As part of the proof of concept, we also demonstrate that the machine learning environment can identify, and learn to correct for, incomplete physical descriptions within a reservoir simulator. The PoroTwin thus shows the potential of a fully integrated experimental and automated learning environment.},

            NorthWind, a collaborative research initiative supported by the Research Council of Norway, industry stakeholders, and research partners, aims to advance cutting-edge research and innovation in wind energy. The core mission is to reduce wind power costs and foster sustainable growth, with a key focus on the development of digital twins. A digital twin is a virtual representation of physical assets or processes that uses data and simulators to enable real-time forecasting, optimization, monitoring, control and informed decision-making. Recently, a hierarchical scale ranging from 0 to 5 (0 - Standalone, 1 - Descriptive, 2 - Diagnostic, 3 - Predictive, 4 - Prescriptive, 5 - Autonomous has been introduced within the NorthWind project to assess the capabilities of digital twins.

            Reduced basis methods (RB methods or RBMs) form one of the most promising techniques to deliver numerical solutions of parametrized PDEs in real-time with reasonable accuracy [1]. For the Navier-Stokes equation, RBMs based on stable velocity-pressure spaces do not generally inherit the stability of the high-fdelity method. Common techniques for working around this problem (e.g. [2]) have the effect of deteriorating the performance of the RBM in the performance-critical online stage.
            We show how divergence-free reduced formulations eliminates this problem, producing RBMs that are faster by an order of magnitude or more in the online stage. This is most easily achieved using divergence-conforming compatible B-spline bases, using a transformation that can maintain the divergence-free property under variable geometries. See [3] for more details.
            We also demonstrate the flexibility of RBMs for non-stationary flow problems using a problem with two stages: an initial, finite transient stage where the flow pattern settles from the initial data, followed by a terminal and infinite oscillatory stage characterized by vortex shedding. We show how an RBM whose data is only sourced from the terminal stage nevertheless can produce solutions that pass through the initial stage without critical problems (e.g. crashing, diverging or blowing up).},

Two years of measurements are analysed, using data from 25 three-dimensional sonic anemometers mounted at heights from 12 ​m to 95 ​m above the ground. The goal is to explore the potential and challenges of using wind measurements from the masts located on the shores of the fjords in the design of planned bridge crossings. Therefore, the study explores the deviations of the mean and turbulent flow characteristics from the traditional case of flat and homogeneous terrain. Only records with mean wind speeds of 12 ​m ​s−1 and above at all elevations above the ground are considered due to their relevance in buffeting response, which led to the identification of a limited number of sectors representative of strong wind conditions. Mean incidence angles with absolute values above 6° and low mean wind shear are measured in several of the selected sectors. This highlights the major influence of the local terrain and vegetation around the masts on the wind conditions at the mast locations. Nevertheless, non-dimensional variance and covariance estimates of the velocity components are found to be consistent with values previously measured from bridge decks crossing narrow fjords. The paper explores also an alternative approach to compute the friction velocity, the estimation of which is challenging in a fjord-like topography. This first part of the paper focuses on integral flow characteristics, a second follow-on part will investigate in details which eddy wave-numbers are most affected by the local terrain, based on the analysis of the spectra of the velocity fluctuations.},

This assessment is done by analysing the second-order structure of turbulence in the frequency space. The objective is to evaluate how the data collected by these masts can help with the design of future fjord-crossing bridges. Using measurements from eight masts deployed in three different fjords, spectral characteristics common to the different locations were identified. Among the characteristics investigated, the one-point velocity spectra and the vertical coherence of turbulence are of special interest for bridge design. Using only situations with a mean wind speed of 12 ​m ​s−1 and above and rather stationary flow conditions, the remaining wind direction sectors could be classified into two main groups: those with a long fetch over smooth topography and those with a rough heterogeneous terrain upstream of the masts. It was found that if the velocity spectra are normalized by an appropriate estimate of the friction velocity, surface-layer scaling may be applicable in Norwegian fjords, at least under near-neutral conditions. The velocity spectra, estimated with long upstream fjord fetches have characteristics consistent with those collected in coastal and offshore environments. The Davenport model showed limited capabilities in describing the co-coherence of turbulence on vertical separations. The dependency of the Davenport decay coefficient with the height and spatial separation is highlighted and may be substantial in mountainous terrain. Although the spectral flow characteristics estimated on the shore of fjords are relevant for the design of fjord-crossing bridge towers, they may not easily be extrapolated for the modelling of the turbulent flow in the middle of the fjord. Nevertheless, they are still valuable to complement computational fluid dynamic simulations, wind tunnel tests, or remote sensing of wind across the fjord.},

            Recently, computational modeling has shifted towards the use of statistical inference, deep learning, and other data-driven modeling frameworks. Although this shift in modeling holds promise in many applications like design optimization and real-time control by lowering the computational burden, training deep learning models needs a huge amount of data. This big data is not always available for scientific problems and leads to poorly generalizable data-driven models. This gap can be furnished by leveraging information from physics-based models. Exploiting prior knowledge about the problem at hand, this study puts forth a physics-guided machine learning (PGML) approach to build more tailored, effective, and efficient surrogate models. For our analysis, without losing its generalizability and modularity, we focus on the development of predictive models for laminar and turbulent boundary layer flows. In particular, we combine the self-similarity solution and power-law velocity profile (low-fidelity models) with the noisy data obtained either from experiments or computational fluid dynamics simulations (high-fidelity models) through a concatenated neural network. We illustrate how the knowledge from these simplified models results in reducing uncertainties associated with deep learning models applied to boundary layer flow prediction problems. The proposed multi-fidelity information fusion framework produces physically consistent models that attempt to achieve better generalization than data-driven models obtained purely based on data. While we demonstrate our framework for a problem relevant to fluid mechanics, its workflow and principles can be adopted for many scientific problems where empirical, analytical, or simplified models are prevalent. In line with grand demands in novel PGML principles, this work builds a bridge between extensive physics-based theories and data-driven modeling paradigms and paves the way for using hybrid physics and machine learning modeling approaches for next-generation digital twin technologies.},

	abstract = {In this study, we present a parametric, non-intrusive reduced order modeling (NIROM) framework as a potential digital-twin enabler for fluid flow around an aerofoil. A wind turbine blade has its basic foundation in the aerofoil shape. A faster way of understanding dynamic flow changes around the aerofoil-shaped blade can help make quick decisions related to wind-turbine operations and lead to optimal aerodynamic performance and power production. In this direction, a case study involving the application of the NIROM methodology for flow prediction around a NACA 0015 aerofoil is considered. The Reynolds number (Re) is the varying parameter, ranging from 320 000 to 1.12 million and high-fidelity CFD simulations are performed to generate the database for developing the NIROM. The aforementioned NIROM framework employs a Grassmann manifold interpolation approach (GI) for obtaining basis functions corresponding to new values of the parameter (Reynolds number), and exploits the time series prediction capabilities of the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network for obtaining temporal coefficients associated with the new basis functions. The methodology involves: (a) an offline training phase, where the LSTM model is trained on the modal coefficients extracted from the sampled high-resolution data using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and (b) an online testing phase, where for the new parameter value, the corresponding flow field is obtained using the GI-modulated basis functions for new parameter and the LSTM-predicted temporal coefficients. The NIROM-approximated flow predictions at new parameters have been compared to the high-dimensional full-order model (FOM) solutions for the high-Re aerofoil case and for a low-Re number wake vortex merger case in order to put the performance of NIROM in perspective. The results indicate that the NIROM framework can qualitatively predict the complex flow scenario around the aerofoil for new values of Reynolds number, while it has quantitatively shown that the LSTM predictions improve with the enrichment of the training space. For the low-Re vortex merger case, NIROM works very well. Thus, it can be deduced that there is scope and potential for continued research in NIROMs as digital twin enablers in wind energy applications.},

	abstract = {Aerodynamic characteristic of a small scale wind turbine under the influence of an incoming uniform wind field is studied using k-ω Shear Stress Transport turbulence model. Firstly, the lift and drag characteristics of the blade section consisting of S826 airfoil is studied using 2D simulations at a Reynolds number of 1×105. After that, the full turbine including the rotational effects of the blade is simulated using Multiple Reference Frames (MRF) and Sliding Mesh Interface (SMI) numerical techniques. The differences between the two techniques are quantified. It is then followed by a detailed comparison of the turbine"s power/thrust output and the associated wake development at three tip speeds ratios (λ = 3, 6, 10). The phenomenon of blockage effect and spatial features of the flow are explained and linked to the turbines power output. Validation of wake profiles patterns at multiple locations downstream is also performed at each λ. The present work aims to evaluate the potential of the numerical methods in reproducing wind tunnel experimental results such that the method can be applied to full-scale turbines operating under realistic conditions in which observation data is scarce or lacking.},

	abstract = {With the recent wave of digitalization, specifically in the context of safety-critical applications, there has been a growing need for computationally efficient, accurate, generalizable, and trustworthy models. Physics-based models have traditionally been used extensively for simulating and understanding complex phenomena. However, these models though trustworthy and generalizable to a wide array of problems, are not ideal for real-time. To address this issue, the physics-based models are simplified. Unfortunately, these simplifications, like reducing the dimension of the problem (3D to 2D) or linearizing the highly non-linear characteristics of the problem, can degrade model accuracy. Data-driven models, on the other hand, can exhibit better computational efficiency and accuracy. However, they fail to generalize and operate as blackbox, limiting their acceptability in safety-critical applications. In the current article, we demonstrate how we can use a data-driven approach to correct for the two kinds of simplifications in a physics-based model. To demonstrate the methodology's effectiveness, we apply the method to model several elasticity problems. The results show that the hybrid approach, which we call the corrective source term approach, can make erroneous physics-based models more accurate and certain. The hybrid model also exhibits superior performance in terms of accuracy, model uncertainty, and generalizability when compared to its end-to-end data-driven modeling counterpart.},

            The prolonged operation of wind turbines in harsh offshore environments leads to deterioration and roughness accumulation on the blade surface. This roughness, particularly on the leading edge and other surfaces, can affect the laminar-to-turbulent transition, alter the flow characteristics in the turbine wake and turbulent boundary layer, and become critical for the accurate design and performance analysis of offshore horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT). This study investigates the effects of blade surface roughness on the aerodynamic performance and wake evolution of the NREL Phase VI wind turbine rotor using the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) technique. First, 2D simulations are validated against experimental data of the S809 airfoil. Then, full-scale 3D simulations of the complete turbine model are conducted with roughness effects to simulate natural conditions. The results show that surface roughness reduces the blade’s aerodynamic performance. The rough surface increases the boundary layer thickness, causing flow separation and turbulence, which decrease the lift generated by the blade and increase its drag, resulting in decreased overall blade performance. At higher wind speeds, surface roughness has a negligible effect on turbine performance due to flow separation at the leading edge. The analysis of surface roughness effects on the turbine wake flow indicates that blade roughness positively correlates with wake recovery, where the wake velocity recovers faster with an increase in roughness height.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a validation of the AROME-SIMRA model, which is a nested computational fluid dynamics model that simulates both mesoscale and microscale phenomena. To validate the model, we analyzed 47 h of mean flow data collected by 13 three-dimensional sonic anemometers. These anemometers were mounted on tall masts located near the shoreline of Sulafjord, with heights ranging from 12m to 95m above the ground. Due to the difficulty measuring wind along the bridge span, analyzing flow conditions for the construction of a bridge that spans a vast fjord is a difficult process. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to validate a nested macroscale–microscale model. This model will be utilized to analyze flow conditions across the span of the proposed bridge crossing in Sulafjord. The study explores the deviation between the measured and the simulated mean turbulence flow characteristics. Only records with the mean wind of 12ms−1 and above at SulaNW met-mast are considered due to their relevance in buffeting response, which led to the identification of a limited number of sectors representative of strong wind conditions. Mean wind speed comparisons show a minimum correlation of 0.6 and a maximum of 0.9 for all the anemometers analyzed. For wind directions, a low correlation between observation and numerical simulation is obtained at SulaSW met-mast located southwest of Sulafjord. A high Angle of Attack is obtained for both simulation and measurements. However, the correlation is dependent on the mast location, wind direction, and anemometer height. Along the bridge span, the flow is largely horizontal for the northwestern flow.},

Although there are some computer-aided simulations, wind tunnel experimental data, and empirical formulas, most of them lack accurate forecasts. In this study, a novel hybrid model, which is a part of a pre-deployment predictive digital twin, is proposed using statistical techniques and machine learning models for accurate and fast forecasting in the design phase of a wind turbine. The statistical model captures the primary dynamics of the wind turbine power curve, while the machine learning model eliminates errors in the model. A logistic function is used as the statistical model for the regression problem, and an artificial neural network with two hidden layers is used for the error model. The model is trained with the dataset available online. The trained model is executed within the digital twin platform, which is built on Unity 3D, enabling the acquisition of both visual and analytical results. The proposed model exhibits 8 percent less root mean square error and 17 percent less mean absolute error compared to the pure statistical technique approach.},

	abstract = {Multiple model reduction techniques have been proposed to tackle linear and non-linear problems. Intrusive model order reduction techniques exhibit high accuracy levels; however, they are rarely used as a standalone industrial tool because of the high level of expertise required in the construction and usage of these techniques. Moreover, the computation time benefit is compromised for highly non-linear problems. On the other hand, non-intrusive methods often struggle with accuracy in non-linear cases, typically requiring a large design of experiments and a large number of snapshots in order to achieve reliable performance. However, generating the stiffness matrix in a non-intrusive approach presents an optimal way to align accuracy with efficiency, combining the advantages of both intrusive and non-intrusive methods. This work introduces a minimally intrusive model order reduction technique that employs machine learning within a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition framework to achieve this alliance. By leveraging outputs from commercial full-order models, this method constructs a reduced-order model that operates effectively without requiring expert user intervention. The proposed technique is capable of approximating linear non-affine as well as non-linear terms. It is showcased for linear and non-linear structural mechanics problems.},

	abstract = {A novel adaptive local surface refinement technique based on Locally Refined Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (LR NURBS) is presented. LR NURBS can model complex geometries exactly and are the rational extension of LR B-splines. The local representation of the parameter space overcomes the drawback of non-existent local refinement in standard NURBS-based isogeometric analysis. For a convenient embedding into general finite element code, the Bézier extraction operator for LR NURBS is formulated. An automatic remeshing technique is presented that allows adaptive local refinement and coarsening of LR NURBS. In this work, LR NURBS are applied to contact computations of 3D solids and membranes. For solids, LR NURBS-enriched finite elements are used to discretize the contact surfaces with LR NURBS finite elements, while the rest of the body is discretized by linear Lagrange finite elements. For membranes, the entire surface is discretized by LR NURBS. Various numerical examples are shown, and they demonstrate the benefit of using LR NURBS: Compared to uniform refinement, LR NURBS can achieve high accuracy at lower computational cost.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel adaptive crack-tip extended isogeometric analysis (adaptive CT XIGA) framework based on locally refined B-splines (LR B-splines) for efficient and accurate fracture modeling in two-dimensional solids. The XIGA method facilitates crack modeling without requiring the specific locations of crack faces and enables crack propagation simulation without remeshing by employing localized enrichment functions. LR B-splines, as an advanced extension of B-splines and NURBS, offer high-order continuity, precise geometric representation, and local refinement capabilities, thereby enhancing computational accuracy and efficiency. Various local mesh refinement strategies, designed based on crack and crack-tip locations, are investigated. Among these strategies, the crack-tip topological refinement strategy is adopted for local refinement in the adaptive CT XIGA framework. Stress intensity factors (SIFs) are evaluated using the contour interaction integral technique, while the maximum circumferential stress criterion is adopted to predict the crack growth direction. Numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of adaptive CT XIGA. The results confirm that the proposed framework achieves superior error convergence rates and significantly reduces computational costs compared to a-posteriori-error-based adaptive XIGA methods, particularly in crack propagation simulations. These advantages establish adaptive CT XIGA as a powerful and efficient tool for addressing complex fracture problems in solid mechanics.},

When a data set has local details in some areas and is largely smooth elsewhere, LR B-splines allow the spatial distribution of degrees of freedom to follow the variations of the data set. An LRB surface approximating a data set is refined in areas where the accuracy does not meet a required tolerance. In this paper we address, in a systematic study, different LRB refinement strategies and polynomial degrees for surface approximation. We study their influence on the resulting data volume and accuracy when applied to geospatial data sets with different structural behaviour. The relative performance of the refinement strategies is reasonably coherent for the different data sets and this paper concludes with some recommendations. An overall evaluation indicates that bi-quadratic LRB are preferable for the use cases tested, and that the strategies we denote as “full span" have the overall best performance.},

	abstract = {The univariate minimal support B-spline basis (UMB) has been used in Computer Aided Design (CAD) since the 1970s. Freeform curves use UMB, while sculptured surfaces are represented using a tensor product of two UMBs. The coefficients of a B-spline curve and surface are respectively represented in a vector and a rectangular grid. In CAD-intersection algorithms for UMB represented objects, a divide-and-conquer strategy is often used. Refinement by knot insertion is used to split the objects intersected into objects of the same type with a smaller geometric extent. In many cases the intersection of the resulting sub-objects has simpler topology than the original problem. The sub-objects created are represented using their parents’ UMB format and deleted when the sub-problem is solved. Consequently, no global representations of the locally refined bases are needed. This is contrary to when locally refined splines are used for approximation of large point sets. As soon as a B-spline is locally refined, the regular structure of UMB objects in CAD is no longer valid. In this chapter we discuss how Locally Refined B-splines (LR B-splines) address this challenge and present the properties of LR B-splines.},

	abstract = {We generate hierarchical T-meshes by repeatedly inserting new line segments, in order to adapt both the size and the shape of the cells to the specific requirements of the underlying application. The associated spaces of bilinear spline functions are spanned by the locally refined (LR) B-splines of Dokken et al. (2013), which are products of univariate B-splines defined over local knot vectors. Our method guarantees that these functions are linearly independent for the obtained class of hierarchical T-meshes. Furthermore, they even possess the property of local linear independence, since exactly 4 functions take non-zero values on each cell of the mesh, and they form a partition of unity without the need to perform additional scaling or truncation. The correctness of our refinement algorithm is verified by enumerating the (newly introduced) local configurations, which represent the possible topologies of the mesh in the vicinity of a cell. It is then shown that the method works well in all the resulting situations. The fairly large number (385) of cases sheds some light on the challenges associated with linear independence in the context of LR B-spline refinement. Additionally we apply our method to meshes that possess the additional property local semi-regularity (first studied by Weller and Hagen, 1995), where only 49 topologically different situations may arise. However, we observe that the resulting class of hierarchical T-meshes is less flexible, which leads to a substantial amount of excess refinement in applications. Finally we note that the same construction can be applied to generate basis functions for Cs–smooth spline spaces of degree p=2s+1, again with the property of local linear independence.},

We do a numerical investigation of aerodynamic flow around an airfoil cross-section (NACA64) at low Reynolds number and compare the ROM results obtained with high-fidelity FV-generated snapshots against similar high-fidelity results obtained with FE using Taylor–Hood velocity and pressure spaces.

              Numerical challenges occur in the simulation of groundwater flow problems because of complex boundary conditions, varying material properties, presence of sources or sinks in the flow domain, or a combination of these. In this paper, we apply adaptive isogeometric finite element analysis using locally refined (LR) B‐splines to address these types of problems. The fundamentals behind isogeometric analysis and LR B‐splines are briefly presented. Galerkin's method is applied to the standard weak formulation of the governing equation to derive the linear system of equations. A posteriori error estimates are calculated to identify which B‐splines should be locally refined. The error estimates are calculated based on recovery of the
              L
              2
              ‐projected solution. The adaptive analysis method is first illustrated by performing simulation of benchmark problems with analytical solutions. Numerical applications to two‐dimensional groundwater flow problems are then presented. The problems studied are flow around an impervious corner, flow around a cutoff wall, and flow in a heterogeneous medium. The convergence rates obtained with adaptive analysis using local refinement were, in general, observed to be of optimal order in contrast to simulations with uniform refinement.

reduced integration may be used to alleviate transverse shear and membrane locking in

            In recent years, there has been growing interest in digital twin technology in both industry and academia. This versatile technology has found applications across various industries. Wind energy systems are particularly suitable for digital twin platforms due to the integration of multiple subsystems. This study aims to explore the current state of predictive digital twin platforms for wind energy systems by surveying literature from the past five years, identifying challenges and limitations, and addressing future research opportunities. This review is structured around four main research questions. It examines commonly employed methodologies, including physics-based modeling, data-driven approaches, and hybrid modeling. Additionally, it explores the integration of data from various sources such as IoT sensors, historical databases, and external application programming interfaces. The review also delves into key features and technologies behind real-time systems, including communication networks, edge computing, and cloud computing. Finally, it addresses current challenges in predictive digital twin platforms. Addressing these research questions enables the development of hybrid modeling strategies with data fusion algorithms, which allow for interpretable predictive digital twin platforms in real time. Filter methods with dimensionality reduction algorithms minimize the computational resource demand in real-time operating algorithms. Moreover, advancements in high-bandwidth communication networks facilitate efficient data transmission between physical assets and digital twins with reduced latency.},

	abstract = {This paper aims at passive noise control for vibroacoustic problems, which are analyzed by finite and boundary element techniques. The author distinguishes interior and exterior problems mainly because of the quantities used as the objective function to assess the acoustic quality. For interior problems, it is common to use local quantities such as the sound pressure at a field point or, in rare cases, energy density at a field point. The situation is different for exterior problems where the radiated sound power accounts for a suitable and global quantity to assess the emission from a vibrating structure. For most engineering purposes, the assessment requires frequency sweeps in which the problem needs to be solved at many discrete frequencies. In vibroacoustic optimization and in sampling based uncertainty quantification, it is very common that structural parameters are varied, while the acoustic field remains the same throughout the entire process. We will review concepts and recent developments of efficient frequency sweeps and repeated analysis with unmodified fluid domain. For many practical cases, the situation for interior problems is rather simple to survey. Either the authors have applied a modal analysis and used a modal superposition for the frequency sweep and repeated analysis, or the concept of unmodified acoustic transfer vectors is applied. Both concepts are quite successful as long as certain conditions are fulfilled. For exterior problems, a modal superposition is possible but, so far, only for a limited number of cases practically applicable as discussed herein. The concept of using acoustic transfer vectors becomes inefficient since the evaluation of the radiated sound power asanintegral over a closed enveloping surface would require an excessively high amount of storage capacity. Therefore, other concepts are being followed. For frequency sweeps, a number of methods are using a frequency interpolation based on a limited number of discrete sample frequencies. Often, these techniques are used together with Krylov–subspace model order reduction techniques. Further recently published approaches investigate low-rank approximations, greedy algorithms, and deflated Krylov subspace techniques. A completely different kind of approach is based on multi–fidelity models and Gaussian processes. The field of efficient repeated analysis shows some interesting developments, which can be easily applied to sampling based uncertainty quantification but do not seem to be easily and generally applied to optimization.},

The finite element method is used for simulating thin-shell vibration and the boundary element method for exterior acoustic fields. Moreover, the finite element and boundary element methods are implemented in the context of isogeometric analysis, whereby the geometric accuracy and high order continuity of Kirchhoff-Love shells can be guaranteed and meantime no meshing is necessary. The topology optimization method takes continuous material interpolation functions in the density and bulk modulus, and adopts adjoint variable methods for sensitivity analysis. The reduced order model is constructed based on second-order Arnoldi algorithm combined with Taylor's expansions which eliminate the frequency dependence of the system matrices. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the efficiency of broadband topology optimization analysis.},

	abstract = {Ideally, optimum power for a single turbine is obtained when the wind-turbine is aligned with the wind direction. However in multi-turbine wind-farm set-up, wake effects lead to decreased power production from downstream turbine [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Hence, a control strategy based on wake steering involves misalignment of upstream turbines with the wind direction causing their wakes to deflect away from downstream wind turbines needs to be investigated. A great deal of work has been put into dynamically controlling the orientation of the individual wind turbines to maximize the power output of the farm [6, 7, 8, 9]. In the wake-steering based control, the misaligned wind turbines produce less power, while the performance of downstream turbines gets enhanced which increases overall net power gain for the wind power plant. Traditionally, the benefits of wake steering have been demonstrated assuming fixed wind directions (e.g., using high-fidelity modeling). Amongst the most recent techniques, particularly promising is the use of Reinforcement learning (RL), which is a branch of machine learning where models are trained to make decisions based on observations of their environment. It is a flexible framework for devising strategies for solving optimal control problems in a broad range of applications across the sciences. Early attempts at using Reinforcement learning for wake steering have been carried out [7, 8, 9], and show promising results. In practice, however, wake-steering controllers must operate in dynamic wind environments in which the wind conditions are estimated from imperfect measurements. Hence, a reinforcement learning framework is developed in this work for dynamic wind conditions. The results show that the framework is promising, and we compare the deep reinforcement learning approach against a considerably more expensive traditional optimization approach which serves as a good baseline. Future work could include looking at more realistic wake models, steering in the presence of noisy observations, and incorporating weather predictions.},

	abstract = {Frequency sweep problems arise in many structural dynamic, acoustic, and structural acoustic applications. In each case, they incur the evaluation of a frequency response function for a typically large number of frequencies. Because each function evaluation requires the solution of an often large-scale system of equations, frequency sweep problems are computationally intensive. Interpolatory model order reduction is a powerful tool for reducing their cost. However, the performance of this tool depends on the location and number of the interpolation frequency points. It also depends on the number of consecutive frequency derivatives of the response function that are matched at each frequency point. So far, these two choices have been made in the literature in a heuristic manner. In contrast, this paper proposes an automatic adaptive strategy based on monitoring the Euclidean norm of the relative residual associated with the function to be evaluated over the frequency band of interest. More speciﬁcally, the number of interpolation points and the number of matched frequency derivatives are adaptively increased until the global Euclidean norm of the relative residual is reduced below a user-speciﬁed tolerance. The robustness, accuracy, and computational efﬁciency of this adaptive strategy are highlighted with the solution of several frequency sweep problems associated with large-scale structural dynamic, acoustic, and structural acoustic ﬁnite element models.

	abstract = {Isogeometric analysis is a topic of considerable interest in the ﬁeld of numerical analysis. The boundary element method (BEM) requires only the bounding surface of geometries to be described; this makes non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS), which commonly describe the bounding curve or surface of geometries in CAD software, appear to be a natural tool for the approach. This isogeometric analysis BEM (IGABEM) provides accuracy beneﬁts over conventional BEM schemes due to the analytical geometry provided by NURBS. When applied to wave problems, it has been shown that enriching BEM approximations with a partition-of-unity basis, in what has become known as the PU-BEM, allows highly accurate solutions to be obtained with a much reduced number of degrees of freedom. This paper combines these approaches and presents an extended isogeometric BEM (XIBEM) which uses partition-ofunity enriched NURBS functions; this new approach provides beneﬁts which surpass those of both the IGABEM and the PU-BEM. Two numerical examples are given: a single scattering cylinder and a multiple-scatterer made up of two capsules and a cylinder.},

	url = {http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/10655/},
	abstract = {This thesis concerns numerical acoustic wave scattering analysis. Such problems have been solved with computational procedures for decades, with the boundary element method being established as a popular choice of approach. However, such problems become more computationally expensive as the wavelength of an incident wave decreases; this is because capturing the oscillatory nature of the incident wave and its scattered field requires increasing numbers of nodal variables.

Authors from mathematical and engineering backgrounds have attempted to overcome this problem using a wide variety of procedures. One such approach, and the approach which is further developed in this thesis, is to include the fundamental character of wave propagation in the element formulation. This concept, known as the Partition of Unity Boundary Element Method (PU-BEM), has been shown to significantly reduce the computational burden of wave scattering problems.

This thesis furthers this work by considering the different interpolation functions that are used in boundary elements. Initially, shape functions based on trigonomet- ric functions are developed to increase continuity between elements. Following that, non-uniform rational B-splines, ubiquitous in Computer Aided Design (CAD) soft- ware, are used in developing an isogeometric approach to wave scattering analysis of medium-wave problems. The enriched isogeometric approach is named the eXtended Isogeometric Boundary Element Method (XIBEM).

In addition to the work above, a novel algorithm for finding a uniform placement of points on a unit sphere is presented. The algorithm allows an arbitrary number of points to be chosen; it also allows a fixed point or a bias towards a fixed point to be used. This algorithm is used for the three-dimensional acoustic analyses in this thesis.

The new techniques developed within this thesis significantly reduce the number of degrees of freedom required to solve a problem to a certain accuracy—this reduc- tion is more than 70\% in some cases. This reduces the number of equations that have to be solved and reduces the amount of integration required to evaluate these equations.},

However, conventional high-resolution simulations come with a hefty computational cost, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making. This research addresses this challenge by proposing a machine learning-driven, computationally efficient approach utilizing a modified Generative Adversarial Network. The contribution of this work is threefold. Firstly, we provide access to a unique high-resolution dataset of wind fields in complex terrain. Secondly, we introduce a knowledge-based modification to the loss function, ensuring that the algorithm captures crucial characteristics of the flow within complex terrains. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our approach to enhance wind flow resolution in real-life wind farms. Through this, our method delivers comparable accuracy to high-resolution simulations while substantially reducing computational demands. This advancement greatly enhances the accessibility and efficiency of high-resolution wind field simulations, facilitating real-time optimization of wind farms. Moreover, we illustrate that by designing an appropriate loss function informed by domain knowledge, we can mitigate the need for adversarial training.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study Bénard-Marangoni convection in confined containers where a thin fluid layer is heated from below. We consider containers with circular, square and hexagonal cross-sections. For Marangoni numbers close to the critical Marangoni number, the flow patterns are dominated by the appearance of the well-known hexagonal convection cells. The main purpose of this computational study is to explore the possible patterns the system may end up in for a given set of parameters. In a series of numerical experiments, the coupled fluid-thermal system is started with a zero initial condition for the velocity and a random initial condition for the temperature. For a given set of parameters we demonstrate that the system can end up in more than one state. For example, the final state of the system may be dominated by a steady convection pattern with a fixed number of cells, however, the same system may occasionally end up in a steady pattern involving a slightly different number of cells, or it may end up in a state where most of the cells are stationary, while one or more cells end up in an oscillatory state. For larger aspect ratio containers, we are also able to reproduce dislocations in the convection pattern, which have also been observed experimentally. It has been conjectured that such imperfections (e.g., a localized star-like pattern) are due to small irregularities in the experimental setup (e.g., the geometry of the container). However, we show, through controlled numerical experiments, that such phenomena may appear under otherwise ideal conditions. By repeating the numerical experiments for the same non-dimensional numbers, using a different random initial condition for the temperature in each case, we are able to get an indication of how rare such events are. Next, we study the effect of symmetrizing the initial conditions. Finally, we study the effect of selected geometry deformations on the resulting convection patterns.},

Special studies of the topography close to a number of Norwegian airports that currently receive hourly forecasts of terrain-induced turbulence were also performed. It was found that there is a potential for improving efficiency and robustness as well as accuracy of the micro-scale code at the end of the nested set of numerical weather prediction codes that each resolves different scales and which is used in the forecasting mentioned. The optimizing was done by tuning the shape, size and orientation of the local regions as well as the quality of the spatial grid within the regions. 
    The continuous increase of computational power opens for utilizing finer and larger forecast grids for airport regions with topography that are not resolved with the present grids. This gives promise to using these finer micro-scale grids in operational forecasting in near future. A rough estimate of the present realistic and operational grids is a doubling of grid density horizontally as well as increasing grid density vertically by a factor 1.5 as compared with existing numbers.
   The selected airports were investigated in order to deduce general as well as specific guidelines regarding optimum size, shape and orientation of the micro-scale forecast region relative to the local topography nearby the airports. Details for the selected airports are found in the conclusion section of the report.

	abstract = {In places dominated by irregular terrain, significant topographical modifications are often required to develop new or improve the existing infrastructure like roads, buildings, airport terminals and harbours. If the modifications are proposed close to an airport then it directly impacts flight safety. Impact assessment then attains significance. Here, we describe a numerical algorithm for the excavation of an arbitrary polygonal domain within an area with a given topographic description. Thepotential of the algorithm and its numerical implementation is demonstrated by applying it to an artificial wavy terrain and then to a couple of Norwegian airports. The potential of assessing modified flying conditions close to the ground is also presented. Although the present study is mainly focused on terrain-induced atmospheric turbulence close to airports, the outcome of the present work can also be utillized for other purposes, like building-induced turbulence simulations.

	abstract = {Mixed Reality (MR) is an evolving technology lying in the continuum spanned by related technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), and creates an exciting way of interacting with people and the environment. This technology is fast becoming a tool used by many people, potentially improving living environments and work eﬃciency. Microsoft HoloLens [1] has played an important role in the progress of MR, from the ﬁrst generation to the second generation. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the functions of applicable functions in HoloLens 2 [2]. These evaluations can serve as a performance benchmark that can help people who need to use this instrument for research or applications in the future. The detailed tests and the performance evaluation of the diﬀerent functionalities show the usability and possible limitations of each function. We mainly divide the experiment into the existing functions of the HoloLens 1, the new functions of the HoloLens 2, and the use of research mode. This research results will be useful for MR researchers who want to use HoloLens 2 as a research tool to design their own MR applications.},

	abstract = {In this paper we discuss the numerical solution of the Helmholtz equation with mixed boundary conditions on a 2D physical domain Ω. The so called radiation problem depends on the constant wavenumber k, that in some medical applications can be of order of thousands. For these values of k the classical Finite Element Method (FEM) faces up several numerical difficulties. To mitigate these limitations we apply the Isogeometric Analysis (IgA) to compute the approximated solution uh. Main steps of IgA are discussed and specific proposals for their fulfillment are addressed, with focus on some aspects not covered in available publications. In particular, we introduce a low distortion quadratic NURBS parametrization of Ω that represents exactly its boundary and contributes to the accuracy of uh. Our approach is non-isoparametric since uh is a bicubic tensor product polynomial B-spline function on Ω. This allows to improve the numerical solution refining the approximation space and keeping the coarser parametrization of the domain. Moreover, we discuss the role of the number of degrees of freedom in the directions perpendicular and longitudinal to wave front and its relationship with the noise and the shift in amplitude and phase of uh. The linear system derived from IgA discretization of the radiation problem is solved using GMRES and we show through experiments that the incomplete factorization of the Complex Shifted Laplacian provides a very good preconditioner. To solve the radiation problem, we have implemented IgA approach using the open source package GeoPDEs. A comparison with FEM is included, to provide evidence that IgA approach is superior since it is able to reduce significantly the pollution error, especially for high values of k, producing additionally smoother solutions which depend on less degrees of freedom.},

	abstract = {Many numerical procedures are published or under development for the evaluation of radiation from or scattering at irregular objects. It is a good practice to check such procedures with benchmark objects. A favourite object is the "cat's eye" model. Like other benchmark objects, the
cat's eye can serve its purpose only when there is available a precise solution for the tasks of radiation and scattering. Therefore an analytical formulation of the sound field around a cat's eye shall be formulated which is suited for numerical evaluation. The fields in the different zones
are expanded as sums of orthogonal modes of the zones. The formulation is precise in the sense of a Fourier analysis, i.e., the field matching at the zone limits is performed with the principle of minimum square error over the zone boundary surfaces.},

	abstract = {The mesh assessment problem is investigated in this paper by taking into account the shape and size of elements and the solution behavior. Three elementwise mesh quality measures characterizing the shape, alignment, and adaptation features of elements are introduced according to the estimates of interpolation error developed on a general mesh. An adaptive mesh is assessed by an overall quality measure defined as a weighted Lebesgue norm of a product of the three elementwise quality measures. It is shown that the overall quality of a mesh is good if the overall mesh quality measure is small or significantly smaller than the so-called roughness measure of the solution, defined as the ratio of two Lebesgue norms of a derivative of the solution. The definition of the overall mesh quality measure comes in such a way that the measure appears in the underlying error bound as the only factor depending substantially on the mesh. As an immediate result, the task of mesh adaptation becomes to control the overall mesh quality. This idea is applied to variational mesh adaptation to develop two functionals, one new and the other related to an existing functional recently developed using the regularity and equidistribution arguments. Numerical experiments are given to demonstrate the ability of the functionals to generate adaptive meshes of good quality.},

This is motivated by the fact that, as \$\${\textbackslash}varepsilon \$\$increases, the shifted problem becomes easier to solve iteratively.

In this paper, we focus on the question of how large \$\${\textbackslash}varepsilon \$\$can be so that the shifted problem provides a preconditioner that leads to \$\$k\$\$-independent convergence of GMRES, and our main result is a sufficient condition on \$\${\textbackslash}varepsilon \$\$for this property to hold. This result holds for finite element discretisations of both the interior impedance problem and the sound-soft scattering problem (with the radiation condition in the latter problem imposed as a far-field impedance boundary condition). Note that we do not address the important question of how large \$\${\textbackslash}varepsilon \$\$should be so that the preconditioner can easily be inverted by standard iterative methods.},

Laird [Preconditioned iterative solution of the 2D Helmholtz equation, First Year's Report, St. Hugh's College, Oxford, 2001] proposed a preconditioner where an extra term is added to the Laplace operator. This term is similar to the zeroth order term in the Helmholtz equation but with reversed sign. In this paper, both approaches are further generalized to a new class of preconditioners, the so-called “shifted Laplace” preconditioners of the form Δφ−αk2φ with α∈C. Numerical experiments for various wavenumbers indicate the effectiveness of the preconditioner. The preconditioner is evaluated in combination with GMRES, Bi-CGSTAB, and CGNR.},

This new scheme mainly owns two advantages: the first one is low computational costs since the classical projection method decouples the reduced-order velocity variable and reduced-order pressure variable, and POD technique further improves the computational efficiency; the second advantage consists of circumventing the verification of classical LBB/inf-sup condition for mixed POD spaces with the help of pressure stabilized Petrov-Galerkin(PSPG)-type projection method, where the pressure stabilization term is inherent which allows the use of non inf-sup stable elements without adding extra stabilization terms. We first obtain the convergence of PSPG-type finite element projection scheme, and then analyze the proposed projection POD-ROM's stability and convergence.

The physical asset in our setup is a meter-scale FluidFlower rig. The digital twin consists of a traditional physics-based forward simulation tool and a correction technique which compensates for mismatches between simulation results and observations. The latter augments the range of the physics-based simulation and allows us to bridge the gap between simulation and experiments in a quantitative sense. We describe the setup of the physical and digital twin, including data transfer protocols using cloud technology. The accuracy of the digital twin is demonstrated on a case with artificially high diffusion that must be compensated by the correction approach, as well as by simulations in geologically complex media. The digital twin is then applied to control tracer transport by manipulating fluid injection and production in the experimental rig, thereby enabling two-way coupling between the physical and digital twins.},

	abstract = {High fidelity simulations of flow can be quite demanding, involving up to O(106) to O(109) degrees of freedom, and several hours or days of computational time, even on powerful parllel architectures. These techniques become prohibitive when expected to deal quickly and efficiently with repetitive solutions of partial differential equations. One set of PDE encountered on a regular basis is the Navier Stokes equation, used to simulate flow around complex geometries, e.g. sub-sea structures. To address the issues associated with computational efficiency, the field of Reduced Order Modelling (ROM) is evolving quickly. In this paper, we investigate the use of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) as a potential method for constructing reduced bases for such ROMs. In the case of flow around cylindrical bodies and the NACA 0015 airfoil we found that only a few modes were sufficient to represent the dominant flow structures and their associated energies. This makes POD an attractive candidate for constructing such bases.},

	abstract = {A modern ship is fitted with numerous sensors and Data Acquisition Systems (DAQs) each of which can be viewed as a data collection source node. These source nodes transfer data to one another and to one or many centralized systems. The centralized systems or data interpreter nodes can be physically located onboard the vessel or onshore at the shipping data control center. The main purpose of a data interpreter node is to assimilate the collected data and present or relay it in a concise manner. The interpreted data can further be visualized and used as an integral part of a monitoring and decision support system. This paper presents a simple data processing framework based on big data analytics. The framework uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a tool to process data gathered through in-service measurements onboard a ship during various operational conditions. Weather hindcast data is obtained from various sources to account for environmental loads on the ship. The proposed framework reduces the dimensionality of high dimensional data and determines the correlation between data variables. The accuracy of the model is evaluated based on the data recorded during the voyage of a ship.},

Compared to the introduced RL algorithms, the results show that the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm exhibits superior robustness to changes in the environment complexity, the reward function, and when generalized to environments with a considerable domain gap from the training environment. Whereas the proposed reward function significantly improves the competing algorithms’ ability to solve the training environment, an unexpected consequence of the dimensionality reduction in the sensor suite, combined with the domain gap, is identified as the source of their impaired generalization performance.},

	abstract = {Human mobility impacts many aspects of a city, from its spatial structure1–3 to its response to an epidemic4–7. It is also ultimately key to social interactions8, innovation9,10 and productivity11. However, our quantitative understanding of the aggregate movements of individuals remains incomplete. Existing models—such as the gravity law12,13 or the radiation model14—concentrate on the purely spatial dependence of mobility flows and do not capture the varying frequencies of recurrent visits to the same locations. Here we reveal a simple and robust scaling law that captures the temporal and spatial spectrum of population movement on the basis of large-scale mobility data from diverse cities around the globe. According to this law, the number of visitors to any location decreases as the inverse square of the product of their visiting frequency and travel distance. We further show that the spatio-temporal flows to different locations give rise to prominent spatial clusters with an area distribution that follows Zipf’s law15. Finally, we build an individual mobility model based on exploration and preferential return to provide a mechanistic explanation for the discovered scaling law and the emerging spatial structure. Our findings corroborate long-standing conjectures in human geography (such as central place theory16 and Weber’s theory of emergent optimality10) and allow for predictions of recurrent flows, providing a basis for applications in urban planning, traffic engineering and the mitigation of epidemic diseases.},

	title = {Isogeometric analysis of phase-field models for dynamic brittle and ductile fracture},
	url = {https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2012-08-6113},
	abstract = {To date, efforts to model fracture and crack propagation have focused on two broad approaches: discrete and continuum damage descriptions.  The discrete approach incorporates a discontinuity into the displacement field that must be tracked and updated.  Examples of this approach include XFEM, element deletion, and cohesive zone models.  The continuum damage, or smeared crack, approach incorporates a damage parameter into the model that controls the strength of the material.  An advantage of this approach is that it does not require interface tracking since the damage parameter varies continuously over the domain. An alternative approach is to use a phase-field to describe crack propagation.  In the phase-field approach to modeling fracture the problem is reformulated in terms of a coupled system of partial differential equations.  A continuous scalar-valued phase-field is introduced into the model to indicate whether the material is in the unfractured or fractured ''phase''.  The evolution of the phase-field is governed by a partial differential equation that includes a driving force that is a function of the strain energy of the body in question.  This leads to a coupling between the momentum equation and the phase-field equation.  The phase-field model also includes a length scale parameter that controls the width of the smooth approximation to the discrete crack.  This allows discrete cracks to be modeled down to any desired length scale.  Thus, this approach incorporates the strengths of both the discrete and continuum damage models, i.e., accurate modeling of individual cracks with no interface tracking. The research presented in this dissertation focuses on developing phase-field models for dynamic fracture.  A general formulation in terms of the usual balance laws supplemented by a microforce balance law governing the evolution of the phase-field is derived.  From this formulation, small-strain brittle and large-deformation ductile models are then derived.  Additionally, a fourth-order theory for the phase-field approximation of the crack path is postulated.  Convergence and approximation results are obtained for the proposed theories.  In this work, isogeometric analysis, and particularly T-splines, plays an important role by providing a smooth basis that allows local refinement.  Several numerical simulations have been performed to evaluate the proposed theories.  These results show that phase-field models are a powerful tool for predicting fracture.},

	abstract = {In most of the engineering and industrial flow applications, one encounters fluid-structure interaction. This interaction can lead to some undesirable forces acting on the structure, causing its damage or fatigue. The phenomenon, being complex in nature, requires thorough understanding of the flow physics. Analyzing canonical flows, such as the flow past a cylinder, provides fundamental concepts governing the fluid behavior. Despite a simpler geometry, studying such flows are a building block in an effort to comprehend, model, and control complicated flows. For the flow past a circular cylinder, we examine the phenomenon of vortex shedding observed in many bluff body wakes. We develop a parallel computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on curvilinear coordinates to analyze vortex shedding. The algorithm is implemented on a distributed-memory, message-passing parallel computer, and a domain decomposition technique is employed to partition the grid into various processors. We validate and verify the numerical results with existing experimental and numerical studies. We analyse the performance of the parallel CFD solver by computing the speed-up and efficiency of the solver. We also show that the algorithm is scalable and can be efficiently employed to study other engineering problems requiring larger grid sizes and computational domains. Various other features of the solver, such as the turbulence model, moving boundary techniques, shear, and other canonical flows are also presented. 

Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are performed to simulate the flow past a circular cylinder to compute the velocity and pressure fields. Based on the flow realizations of the DNS data, we use the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) tool to determine the minimum degrees of freedom (or modes) required to represent the flow field. For the current nonlinear problem, the dominant POD modes are used in a Galerkin procedure to project the Navier-Stokes equations onto a low-dimensional space, thereby reducing the distributed-parameter problem into a finite-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system in time. We use long-time integration of the reduced-order model to calculate periodic solutions and alternatively use a shooting technique to home on the system limit cycles. We obtain the pressure-Poisson equation by taking the divergence of the Navier-Stokes equation and then project it onto the pressure POD modes. Then, we decompose the pressure into lift and drag components and compare the results with the CFD results. To reduce the fluctuating forces on the structure, we implement full-state feedback control on the low-dimensional model with suction applied aft of the separation point. The control algorithm is successfully simulated using the CFD code and suppression of vortex-shedding is achieved.},

	abstract = {This work considers the stability of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) basis interpolation on Grassmann manifolds for parametric Model Order Reduction (pMOR) in hyperelasticity. The article contribution is mainly about stability conditions, all defined from strong mathematical background. We show how the stability of interpolation can be lost if certain geometrical requirements are not satisfied by making a concrete elucidation of the local character of linearization. To this effect, we draw special attention to the Grassmannian Exponential map and optimal injectivity condition of this map, related to the cut--locus of Grassmann manifolds. From this, explicit stability conditions are established and can be directly used to determine the loss of injectivity in practical pMOR applications. Another stability condition is formulated when increasing the number p of mode, deduced from principal angles of subspaces of different dimensions p. This stability condition helps to explain the non-monotonic oscillatory behavior of the error-norm with respect to the number of POD modes, and on the contrary, the monotonic decrease of the error-norm in the two benchmark numerical examples considered herein. Under this study, pMOR is applied in hyperelastic structures using a non-intrusive approach for inserting the interpolated spatial POD ROM basis in a commercial FEM code. The accuracy is assessed by {\textbackslash}emph\{a posteriori\} error norms defined using the ROM FEM solution and its high fidelity counterpart simulation. Numerical studies successfully ascertained and highlighted the implication of stability conditions. The various stability conditions can be applied to a variety of other relevant problems involving parametrized ROMs generation based on POD basis interpolation via Grassmann manifolds.},

Our approximation and a posteriori error bound framework is of particular computational relevance for the static condensation reduced basis element (SCRBE) method. We provide several numerical examples within the SCRBE context, which serve to demonstrate the convergence rate of our port approximation procedure as well as the efficacy of our port reduction error bounds.},

The main modeling challenge addressed in this work, which is a challenge for all diffuse crack representations, is on how to allow for the flow of fluid and the action of fluid pressure on the aggregate within the diffuse damage zone of the cracks. The theory is constructed by presenting the general physical balance laws and conducting a consistent thermodynamic analysis to constrain the constitutive relationships. Constitutive equations that reproduce the desired responses at the various limits of the phase-field parameter are proposed in order to capture Darcy-type flow in the intact porous medium and Stokes-type flow within open cracks. A finite element formulation for the solution of the governing model equations is presented and discussed. Finally, the theoretical and numerical model is shown to compare favorably to several important analytical solutions. More complex and interesting calculations are also presented to illustrate some of the advantageous features of the approach.},

	abstract = {We present a survey of the fundamentals and the applications of sparse grids, with a focus on the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The sparse grid approach, introduced in Zenger (1991), is based on a higher-dimensional multiscale basis, which is derived from a one-dimensional multi-scale basis by a tensor product construction. Discretizations on sparse grids involve \$O(N {\textbackslash}cdot ({\textbackslash}log N){\textasciicircum}\{d-1\})\$ degrees of freedom only, where \$d\$ denotes the underlying problem's dimensionality and where \$N\$ is the number of grid points in one coordinate direction at the boundary. The accuracy obtained with piecewise linear basis functions, for example, is \$O(N{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} {\textbackslash}cdot ({\textbackslash}log N){\textasciicircum}\{d-1\})\$ with respect to the \$L\_\{2{\textasciicircum}-\}\$ and \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}infty\}\$-norm, if the solution has bounded second mixed derivatives. This way, the curse of dimensionality, i.e., the exponential dependence \$O(N{\textasciicircum}d)\$ of conventional approaches, is overcome to some extent. For the energy norm, only \$O(N)\$ degrees of freedom are needed to give an accuracy of \$O(N{\textasciicircum}\{-1\})\$. That is why sparse grids are especially well-suited for problems of very high dimensionality. The sparse grid approach can be extended to nonsmooth solutions by adaptive refinement methods. Furthermore, it can be generalized from piecewise linear to higher-order polynomials. Also, more sophisticated basis functions like interpolets, prewavelets, or wavelets can be used in a straightforward way. We describe the basic features of sparse grids and report the results of various numerical experiments for the solution of elliptic PDEs as well as for other selected problems such as numerical quadrature and data mining.},

We have used this algorithm for the construction of symmetric and non-symmetric quadrature rules over convex and concave polygons. While in the case of symmetric quadratures our results are comparable to available rules, the proposed algorithm has the advantage of being flexible enough so that it can be applied to arbitrary planar regions for the integration of generalized classes of functions. To demonstrate the efficiency of the new quadrature rules, we have tested them for the integration of rational polygonal shape functions over a regular hexagon. For a relative error of 10−8 in the computation of stiffness matrix entries, one needs at least 198 evaluation points when the region is partitioned, whereas 85 points suffice with our quadrature rule.

Explicit characterizations of the quotient manifold, its tangent space and the tangent space of HT,k are derived, suitable for high-dimensional problems. The usefulness of a complete geometric description is demonstrated by two typical applications. First, new convergence results for the nonlinear Gauss–Seidel method on HT,k are given.

	abstract = {The computational modeling of failure mechanisms in solids due to fracture based on sharp crack discontinuities suffers in situations with complex crack topologies. This can be overcome by a diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a crack phase field. Following our recent work [C. Miehe, F. Welschinger, M. Hofacker, Thermodynamically-consistent phase field models of fracture: Variational principles and multi-field fe implementations, International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering DOI:10.1002/nme.2861] on phase-field-type fracture, we propose in this paper a new variational framework for rate-independent diffusive fracture that bases on the introduction of a local history field. It contains a maximum reference energy obtained in the deformation history, which may be considered as a measure for the maximum tensile strain obtained in history. It is shown that this local variable drives the evolution of the crack phase field. The introduction of the history field provides a very transparent representation of the balance equation that governs the diffusive crack topology. In particular, it allows for the construction of a new algorithmic treatment of diffusive fracture. Here, we propose an extremely robust operator split scheme that successively updates in a typical time step the history field, the crack phase field and finally the displacement field. A regularization based on a viscous crack resistance that even enhances the robustness of the algorithm may easily be added. The proposed algorithm is considered to be the canonically simple scheme for the treatment of diffusive fracture in elastic solids. We demonstrate the performance of the phase field formulation of fracture by means of representative numerical examples.},

	abstract = {Phase-field modeling of fracture phenomena in solids is a very promising approach which has gained popularity within the last decade. However, within the finite element framework, already a two-dimensional quasi-static phase-field formulation is computationally quite demanding, mainly for the following reasons: (i) the need to resolve the small length scale inherent to the diffusive crack approximation calls for extremely fine meshes, at least locally in the crack phase-field transition zone, (ii) due to non-convexity of the related free-energy functional, a robust, but slowly converging staggered solution scheme based on algorithmic decoupling is typically used. In this contribution we tackle problem (ii) and propose a faster and equally accurate approach for quasi-static phase-field computing of (brittle) fracture using a monolithic solution scheme which is accompanied by a novel line search procedure to overcome the iterative convergence issues of non-convex minimization. We present a detailed critical evaluation of the approach and its comparison with the staggered scheme in terms of computational cost, accuracy and robustness.},

Field data were provided by Statoil, which conducted a comprehensive test measurement campaign of its demonstration system, a 2.3-MW Siemens turbine mounted on a spar substructure deployed about 10 km off the island of Karmøy in Norway. A top-down approach was used to develop the FAST model, starting with modeling the blades and working down to the mooring system. Design data provided by Siemens and Statoil were used to specify the structural, aerodynamic, and dynamic properties. Measured wind speeds and wave spectra were used to develop the wind and wave conditions used in the model. The overall system performance and behavior were validated for eight sets of field measurements that span a wide range of operating conditions. The simulated controller response accurately reproduced the measured blade pitch and power. The structural and blade loads and spectra of platform motion agree well with the measured data.},

Using this approach and tensor product NURBS approximations it is shown how the solution can be conducted in a standard approach, where main variables are organized at nodes (control points). This leads to an efficient procedure to solve large problems of a general form without the need to develop special solution strategies. The approach is demonstrated on some standard test problems.},

First, we present a simple one-step implicit time integration scheme using an ALS-type solver in the QTT-format. As the second approach, we use the global space-time formulation, resulting in a large block linear system, encapsulating all time steps, and solve it at once in the QTT format. We prove the QTT-rank estimate for certain classes of multivariate potentials and respective solutions in (x, t) variables. The log-linear complexity of storage and the solution time is observed in both spatial and time grid sizes. The method is applied to the Fokker-Planck equation arising from the beads-springs models of polymeric liquids.},

	abstract = {Hybrid physics-machine learning models are increasingly being used in simulations of transport processes. Many complex multiphysics systems relevant to scientific and engineering applications include multiple spatiotemporal scales and comprise a multifidelity problem sharing an interface between various formulations or heterogeneous computational entities. To this end, we present a robust hybrid analysis and modeling approach combining a physics-based full order model (FOM) and a data-driven reduced order model (ROM) to form the building blocks of an integrated approach among mixed fidelity descriptions toward predictive digital twin technologies. At the interface, we introduce a long short-term memory network to bridge these high and low-fidelity models in various forms of interfacial error correction or prolongation. The proposed interface learning approaches are tested as a new way to address ROM-FOM coupling problems solving nonlinear advection-diffusion flow situations with a bifidelity setup that captures the essence of a broad class of transport processes.},

	abstract = {The Kirchhoﬀ approximation (K-A) to calculate the acoustic backscattering of a complex structure can be evaluated using a discretized version of its surface (i.e. a mesh). From the computational viewpoint, the most handy approach is the one based on ﬂat facets. However, in the high frequency range, where the K-A provides good agreement and is therefore applicable, it requires a mesh with such a large number of facets that it turns impractical. To avoid these diﬃculties a mesh of curved triangles can be used to model the scatterer’s complex structure. Previous computational implementations reported in the literature did not accomplish satisfactory results for high frequency. In this work we propose a numerical model based upon an iterative integration using Gauss-Legendre rules. The model was validated against exact solutions and led us to achieve adequate results in the high-frequency range.},

	abstract = {Special integration routines for hypersingular and nearly singular integrals that arise in an Isogeometric Boundary Element Method (IGABEM) are presented. The IGABEM is applied to an acoustic problem in the frequency domain that corresponds to the Helmholtz equation in three dimensions. A major topic of such an acoustical BEM is the non-uniqueness of the conventional boundary integral equation, which can be corrected by the Burton–Miller formulation at the cost of a hypersingular integral that requires the presented routines. The combination of the BEM with an Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) is advantageous, since the exact CAD description is directly incorporated to the numerical simulation. As the geometry is represented exactly, the integration routines become even more relevant and cannot be masked by the geometrical approximation. For the conventional approximation with plane Lagrange elements, a variety of different integration routines exist, but are not investigated in the scope of an IGA. Therefore, the hypersingular integration scheme of Guiggiani is adapted to be applicable to this new methodology. A direct evaluation of the hypersingular integral is possible, instead of an integration over the complete surface, as in the often used regularized boundary integral equation. Additionally, the sinh-transformation for nearly singular integrals is introduced to achieve more accurate results with the same number of integration points as the conventional Gaussian integration. The new formulation is analyzed under the special case of the oscillatory kernels in acoustics.},

	abstract = {We address the problem of model order reduction (MOR) of parametrized dynamical systems. Motivated by reduced basis (RB) methods for partial differential equations, we show that some characteristic components can be transferred to model reduction of parametrized linear dynamical systems. We assume an affine parameter dependence of the system components, which allows an offline/online decomposition and is the basis for efficient reduced simulation. Additionally, error control is possible by a posteriori error estimators for the state vector and output vector, based on residual analysis and primal-dual techniques. Experiments demonstrate the applicability of the reduced parametrized systems, the reliability of the error estimators and the runtime gain by the reduction technique. The a posteriori error estimation technique can straightforwardly be applied to all traditional projection-based reduction techniques of non-parametric and parametric linear systems, such as model reduction, balanced truncation, moment matching, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and so on.},

	abstract = {Wind speed knowledge is prerequisite in the siting of wind turbines. In consequence the wind energy use requires meticulous and specified knowledge of the wind characteristics at a location. This paper presents a method for determining the annual average wind speed at a complex terrain site by using neural networks, when only short term data are available for that site. This information is useful for preliminary calculations of the wind resource at a remote area having only a short time period of wind measurements measurement in a site. Artificial neural networks are useful for implementing non-linear process variables over time, and therefore are a useful tool for estimating the wind speed. The neural network used is multilayer perceptron with three layers and the supervised learning algorithm used is backpropagation. The inputs used in the neural network were wind speed and direction data from a single station, and the training patterns used correspond to sixty days data. The results obtained by simulating the annual average wind speed at the selected site based on data from nearby stations with correlation coefficients above 0.5 were satisfactory, compared with actual values. Reliable estimations were obtained, with errors below 6\%.},

	abstract = {Since wind at the earth's surface has an intrinsically complex and stochastic nature, accurate wind power forecasts are necessary for the safe and economic use of wind energy. In this paper, we investigated a combination of numeric and probabilistic models: a Gaussian process (GP) combined with a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model was applied to wind-power forecasting up to one day ahead. First, the wind-speed data from NWP was corrected by a GP, then, as there is always a defined limit on power generated in a wind turbine due to the turbine controlling strategy, wind power forecasts were realized by modeling the relationship between the corrected wind speed and power output using a censored GP. To validate the proposed approach, three real-world datasets were used for model training and testing. The empirical results were compared with several classical wind forecast models, and based on the mean absolute error (MAE), the proposed model provides around 9\% to 14\% improvement in forecasting accuracy compared to an artificial neural network (ANN) model, and nearly 17\% improvement on a third dataset which is from a newly-built wind farm for which there is a limited amount of training data.},

	abstract = {Selecting a suitable site is a critical step in wind energy projects. In this regard, using appropriate decision criteria plays a significant role. Turbulence intensity is one of the main characteristics of airflow that affects the power production and lifespan of wind turbines. Therefore, it is considered as a wind site selection criterion in this paper. The present paper formulates the effect of turbulence on both power production and lifespan of wind turbines via an equivalent wind power density (WPDeq) function, to use it in the wind site selection process. To implement the proposed methodology, 88 wind sites in Iran have been studied. The results reveal the significant effect of turbulence on the site selection process as some sites have changed their rank up to 8 grades considering turbulence intensity in the siting process. To consider the turbulence intensity as an independent criterion to use it in multi-criteria decision-making methods, its relative importance (weight) have to be calculated. Sensitivity analysis shows that, on average, the relative importance of turbulence intensity over wind power density can be approximated as 1/5. Researchers can quickly consider turbulence intensity in siting process incorporating its weight in the pairwise comparison matrix of multi-criteria decision–making.},

Sharp estimates of the constants of these inequalities are provided, and precise definitions of mesh size that arise naturally in the context of different problems in terms of element geometry are derived.},

The probability of WV related accidents increases in the vicinity of airport runways due to the shorter time of recovery after a WV encounter. Hence, solutions that can reduce the risk of WV encounters are needed to ensure increased flight safety. In this work we propose an interesting approach to model such wake vortices in real time using a hybrid Eulerian- Lagrangian approach. We derive an appropriate mathematical model, and show a comparison of the different types of solvers. We will conclude with a real life application of the methodology by simulating how wake vortices left behind by an aircraft at the Vffirnes airport in Norway get transported and decay under the influence of a background wind and turbulence field. Although the work demonstrates the application in an aviation context the same approach can be used in a wind energy context.},

In all cases conventional acoustic finite elements are used within an inner region close to the inlet. The far field is represented by infinite elements or wave envelope elements. Theory and results are presented for the case with zero mean flow. Comparisons of computed data with analytic solutions and measured values establish the utility of both the infinite element and wave envelope element schemes in determining the near field values of acoustical pressure. The wave envelope scheme is shown to be effective also in the far field. Both schemes use meshes an order of magnitude more sparse that would be required in conventional numerical discretizations, and may consequently be applied at modest computational cost.},

A spline is a piecewise-deﬁned function that satisﬁes continuity constraints between adjacent elements in a mesh. U-splines di↵er from existing spline constructions, such as Non-Uniform Rational B- splines (NURBS), subdivision surfaces, T-splines, and hierarchical B-splines, in that they can accommodate local geometrically exact adaptivity in h (element size), p (polynomial degree), and k (smoothness) simultaneously over more varied mesh topology. U-splines have no restrictions on the placement of T-junctions in the mesh. Mixed element meshes (e.g., triangle and quadrilateral elements in the same surface mesh) are also supported. We conjecture that the U- spline basis is positive, forms a partition of unity, is linearly independent, and provides optimal approximation when used in analysis.},

An overview of the numerical methods and the methodology used to verify the simulation is presented with special emphasis to determine the proper domain size and time-integration period. Then, the time-averaged ﬂow results and turbulent statistics are discussed together with available experimental data showing a fairly good agreement. Finally, frequency analysis of velocity samples is used to analyze both the Kelvin–Helmholtz vortical structures produced by the ﬂow separation at the leading edge of the cylinder and the Von Kármán vortex shedding in the wake region. The former are observed more downstream compared with the experiments suggesting that transition to turbulence may occur later. However, comparison of the turbulent statistics in the near wall region indicates that transition is being well captured.},

	abstract = {Compared with the traditional analysis of computed tomography scans, automatic liver tumor segmentation can supply precise tumor volumes and reduce the inter-observer variability in estimating the tumor size and the tumor burden, which could further assist physicians to make better therapeutic choices for hepatic diseases and monitoring treatment. Among current mainstream segmentation approaches, multi-layer and multi-kernel convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted much attention in diverse biomedical/medical image segmentation tasks with remarkable performance. However, an arbitrary stacking of feature maps makes CNNs quite inconsistent in imitating the cognition and the visual attention of human beings for a specific visual task. To mitigate the lack of a reasonable feature selection mechanism in CNNs, we exploit a novel and effective network architecture, called Tumor Attention Networks (TA-Net), for mining adaptive features by embedding Tumor Attention layers with multi-functional modules to assist the liver tumor segmentation task. In particular, each tumor attention layer can adaptively highlight valuable tumor features and suppress unrelated ones among feature maps from 3D and 2D perspectives. Moreover, an analysis of visualization results illustrates the effectiveness of our tumor attention modules and the interpretability of CNNs for liver tumor segmentation. Furthermore, we explore different arrangements of skip connections in information fusion. A deep ablation study is also conducted to illustrate the effects of different attention strategies for hepatic tumors. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed TA-Net increases the liver tumor segmentation performance with a lower computation cost and a small parameter overhead over the state-of-the-art methods, under various evaluation metrics on clinical benchmark data. In addition, two additional medical image datasets are used to evaluate generalization capability of TA-Net, including the comparison with general semantic segmentation methods and a non-tumor segmentation task. All the program codes have been released at https://github.com/shuchao1212/TA-Net.},

THCCS also preserves geometry during adaptive h-refinement and thus inherits the surface continuity of Catmull–Clark subdivision, namely C2-continuous everywhere except at the local region surrounding extraordinary nodes, where the surface continuity is C1. Adaptive isogeometric analysis is performed with THCCS basis functions on a benchmark problem with extraordinary nodes. Local refinement on complex surfaces is also studied to show potential wide application of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {The boundary representation or B-rep is the prevalent geometry description in computer aided design (CAD). It combines aspects from explicit and implicit geometry and is incompatible with many downstream applications such as finite element analysis (FEA) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM). We develop a semi-automatic frame-field guided parameterization approach that converts trimmed B-rep geometry to conforming, watertight analysis-suitable NURBS. The resulting geometry description is simultaneously suitable for design as well as analysis and therefore avoids the need for further meshing and geometry-processing. While existing frame-field based global parameterization methods offer the high quality necessary in our application, they suffer from several robustness issues. Current challenges mainly stem from the lack of integrability of the frame-field which causes the computed parameterization to fold-over, particularly near parameterization singularities. We propose specialized constraints that incorporate properties of an analytical solution that resolve the poor behavior near singularities. Furthermore, we present a convenient and efficient solution framework that directly incorporates such constraints into a reduced basis. Improved behavior around parameterization singularities simplifies the extraction of a quadrilateral layout. This layout is subsequently fitted with C0 NURBS to yield a conforming watertight model that is analysis suitable. The latter is illustrated by performing isogeometric shell modal analysis on several geometric models.},

In particular, procedures for improving the accuracy, the reliability and the computational efficiency of the finite element solutions are of primary interest here. This is addressed using h-adaptive mesh refinement based on a posteriori error estimation, self-adaptive methods in global incremental/iterative processes, as well as smart algorithms and heuristic approaches based on methods of knowledge engineering. Seemless integration of h-adaptive finite element methods with adaptive step-length control makes it possible to maintain a prescribed accuracy while maintaining the solution efficiency without user intervention throughout the process of a non-linear analysis. Several examples illustrate the merit and potential of the approach studied herein and confirm the feasibility of developing an automatic adaptive environment for geometrically non-linear analysis of shell structures.},

The conceptual basis is the establishment of a direct connection between the Galerkin method and the classical collocation methods, with the perspective of achieving the accuracy of the former with a computational cost of one point evaluation per degree of freedom as in the latter. Variational collocation requires a discrete space constructed by smooth and pointwise non-negative basis functions, which makes the approach immediately applicable to isogeometric analysis and some meshfree methods. In this paper, we concentrate on isogeometric analysis and demonstrate that there exists a set of points such that collocation of the strong form at these points produces the Galerkin solution exactly. We provide an estimate of these points and show that applying isogeometric collocation at the estimated points completely solves the well-known odd/even discrepancy in the order of spatial convergence. We demonstrate the potential of variational collocation with examples of linear and non-linear elasticity as well as Kirchhoff plates.},

In this paper, the methodology is applied to a number of model problems in wave mechanics treated in the Galerkin isogeometric setting. Herein, the resulting surrogate methods are shown to significantly reduce the assembly time in high frequency wave propagation problems. In particular, the assembly time is reduced with negligible loss in solution accuracy. This paper also extends the scope of previous articles in its series by considering multi-patch discretizations of time-harmonic, transient, and nonlinear PDEs as particular use cases of the methodology. Our a priori error analysis for the Helmholtz equation demonstrates that the additional consistency error introduced by the presence of surrogate matrices is independent of the wave number. In addition, our floating point analysis establishes that the computational complexity of the methodology compares favorably to other contemporary fast assembly techniques for isogeometric methods. Our numerical experiments demonstrate clear performance gains for time-harmonic problems, both with and without the presence of perfectly matched layers. Notable speed-ups are also presented for a transient problem with a compressible neo-Hookean material.},

	abstract = {This is the first of two papers concerning superconvergent recovery techniques and a posteriori error estimation. In this paper, a general recovery technique is developed for determining the derivatives (stresses) of the finite element solutions at nodes. The implementation of the recovery technique is simple and cost effective. The technique has been tested for a group of widely used linear, quadratic and cubic elements for both one and two dimensional problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the recovered nodal values of the derivatives with linear and cubic elements are superconvergent. One order higher accuracy is achieved by the procedure with linear and cubic elements but two order higher accuracy is achieved for the derivatives with quadratic elements. In particular, an O(h4) convergence of the nodal values of the derivatives for a quadratic triangular element is reported for the first time. The performance of the proposed technique is compared with the widely used smoothing procedure of global L2 projection and other methods. It is found that the derivatives recovered at interelement nodes, by using L2 projection, are also superconvergent for linear elements but not for quadratic elements. Numerical experiments on the convergence of the recovered solutions in the energy norm are also presented. Higher rates of convergence are again observed. The results presented in this part of the paper indicate clearly that a new, powerful and economical process is now available which should supersede the currently used post-processing procedures applied in most codes.},

This is accomplished by enriching a set of classical smooth interpolants throughout the thickness direction with C° continuous displacement interpolants (piecewise continuous strain field) in the regions where the most critical behaviour is anticipated. C° continuity of the displacement field is maintained by imposing homogeneous boundary conditions on the superimposed field in the portion of the boundary which is not contained within the boundary of the problem.

An error estimate based on local L2-projections is analysed in the case of translation-invariant meshes. It is shown that for general meshes this technique does not lead to an asymptotically exact estimator. The problem is analysed in detail in the one-dimensional setting. It is shown that an asymptotically exact estimator is not the optimal one when the solution is not sufficiently smooth. An optimal estimator for adaptively constructed meshes is given. Finally, a general mathematical framework for the quality assessment of estimators is introduced.},

	abstract = {In the p-version of the finite element method, the triangulation is fixed and the degree p, of the piecewise polynomial approximation, is progressively increased until some desired level of precision is reached.

In this paper, we first establish the basic approximation properties of some spaces of piecewise polynomials defined on a finite element triangulation. These properties lead to an a priori estimate of the asymptotic rate of convergence of the p-version. The estimate shows that the p-version gives results which are not worse than those obtained by the conventional finite element method (called the h-version, in which h represents the maximum diameter of the elements), when quasi-uniform triangulations are employed and the basis for comparison is the number of degrees of freedom. Furthermore, in the case of a singularity problem, we show (under conditions which are usually satisfied in practice) that the rate of convergence of the p-version is twice that of the h-version with quasi-uniform mesh. Inverse approximation theorems which determine the smoothness of a function based on the rate at which it is approximated by piecewise polynomials over a fixed triangulation are proved for both singular and nonsingular problems.

We present numerical examples which illustrate the effectiveness of the p-version for a simple one-dimensional problem and for two problems in two-dimensional elasticity. We also discuss roundoff error and computational costs associated with the p-version. Finally, we describe some important features, such as hierarchic basis functions, which have been utilized in COMET-X, an experimental computer implementation of the p-version.},

The particular objective of the M5 “Uncertainty” competition was to accurately forecast the uncertainty distributions of the realized values of 42,840 time series that represent the hierarchical unit sales of the largest retail company in the world by revenue, Walmart. To do so, the competition required the prediction of nine different quantiles (0.005, 0.025, 0.165, 0.250, 0.500, 0.750, 0.835, 0.975, and 0.995), that can sufficiently describe the complete distributions of future sales. The paper provides details on the implementation and execution of the M5 “Uncertainty” competition, presents its results and the top-performing methods, and summarizes its major findings and conclusions. Finally, it discusses the implications of its findings and suggests directions for future research.},

The purpose of M4 was to replicate the results of the previous ones and extend them into three directions: First significantly increase the number of series, second include Machine Learning (ML) forecasting methods, and third evaluate both point forecasts and prediction intervals. The five major findings of the M4 Competitions are: 1. Out Of the 17 most accurate methods, 12 were “combinations” of mostly statistical approaches. 2. The biggest surprise was a “hybrid” approach that utilized both statistical and ML features. This method’s average sMAPE was close to 10\% more accurate than the combination benchmark used to compare the submitted methods. 3. The second most accurate method was a combination of seven statistical methods and one ML one, with the weights for the averaging being calculated by a ML algorithm that was trained to minimize the forecasting. 4. The two most accurate methods also achieved an amazing success in specifying the 95\% prediction intervals correctly. 5. The six pure ML methods performed poorly, with none of them being more accurate than the combination benchmark and only one being more accurate than Naïve2. This paper presents some initial results of M4, its major findings and a logical conclusion. Finally, it outlines what the authors consider to be the way forward for the field of forecasting.},

R
2
R2
 and polyhedra in 
R
3
R3
. From these estimates, convergence orders for the p-version of the finite element method applied to such problems are readily obtained. The critical issue is the approximation of the singularities which occur at the nonsmooth parts of the domain boundaries. It is seen that the estimates of [11] involving the weighted Sobolev spaces 
Z
s
l
Zls
 are well suited for treating such singular functions, yielding directly the optimal approximation degree, up to an arbitrarily small 
ε
ε
.

Numerical results for two problems from two-dimensional linear elasticity are also presented. The computations show that the predicted order of convergence is achieved even for low values of p. Moreover, in contrast to the usual h-version of the finite element method, the point at which the p-version enters the asymptotic range does not depend on problem parameters such as the Poisson ratio. Some practical implications of the p-version convergence orders for the solvability of elliptic problems with strong singularities are also discussed.},

This truncation not only decreases the overlapping of supports related to basis functions arising from different hierarchical levels, but it also improves the numerical properties of the corresponding hierarchical basis — which is denoted as truncated hierarchical B-spline (THB-spline) basis. Several computed examples will illustrate the adaptive approximation behavior obtained by using a reﬁnement algorithm based on THB-splines.},

The AI agent, which is equipped with multiple rangefinder sensors for obstacle detection, is trained and evaluated in a challenging, stochastically generated simulation environment based on the OpenAI gym Python toolkit. Notably, the agent is provided with real-time insight into its own reward function, allowing it to dynamically adapt its guidance strategy. Depending on its strategy, which ranges from radical path-adherence to radical obstacle avoidance, the trained agent achieves an episodic success rate close to 100\%},

	abstract = {High false alarm rates are a problem in anti-submarine warfare in littoral waters using active broadband sonar. Automatic classification algorithms may help combat this problem by filtering out detections due to non-threatening targets. An important feature for classification purposes is knowledge of the target's depth. Using active sonar with vertical beamforming capabilities, the received signal from a target can be used to find an estimate of the target's depth given an initial guess of the target's horizontal distance from the ship, the bottom profile and the sound speed profile. 

The estimation is done by an optimization algorithm. The algorithm varies relevant parameters and models signals based on these parameters, comparing the modelled signals with the received signal until parameters providing an optimal fit are found. The modelling is based on using a ray tracing procedure to find eigenrays for a candidate target depth, finding vertical arrival angles and arrival times by use of these eigenrays, and synthesizing a signal based on the arrival angles and arrival times. The ray tracing procedure is done numerically using LYBIN, a platform developed by the Norwegian Defence Logistics Organization (NDLO). Three candidate objective functions for comparing recorded signals to modelled signals are presented. 

The validity of the eigenray finding procedure is confirmed, and results from testing the optimization procedure on synthetic data when applying the different objective functions are presented. The results show that the method produces target depth estimates which are suitable for classification purposes.},

Isogeometric analysis was introduced a decade ago and an impressive progress has been made related to many aspects of numerical methods and advanced applications. However, related to adaptive mesh refinement guided by a posteriori error estimators, rather few attempts are pursued besides the use of classical residual based error estimators. In this article, we explore a feature common for Isogeometric analysis (IGA), namely the use of structured tensorial meshes that facilitates superconvergence behavior of the gradient in the Galerkin discretization. By utilizing the concept of structured mesh refinement using LR B-splines, our aim is to facilitate superconvergence behavior for locally refined meshes as well. Superconvergence behavior matches well with the use of recovery based a posteriori estimator in the Superconvergent Patch Recovery (SPR) procedure.

	abstract = {In this investigation, a data-driven turbulence closure framework is introduced and deployed for the subgrid modelling of Kraichnan turbulence. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the fact that snapshots from high-fidelity numerical data are used to inform artificial neural networks for predicting the turbulence source term through localized grid-resolved information. In particular, our proposed methodology successfully establishes a map between inputs given by stencils of the vorticity and the streamfunction along with information from two well-known eddy-viscosity kernels. Through this we predict the subgrid vorticity forcing in a temporally and spatially dynamic fashion. Our study is both a priori and a posteriori in nature. In the former, we present an extensive hyper-parameter optimization analysis in addition to learning quantification through probability-density-function-based validation of subgrid predictions. In the latter, we analyse the performance of our framework for flow evolution in a classical decaying two-dimensional turbulence test case in the presence of errors related to temporal and spatial discretization. Statistical assessments in the form of angle-averaged kinetic energy spectra demonstrate the promise of the proposed methodology for subgrid quantity inference. In addition, it is also observed that some measure of a posteriori error must be considered during optimal model selection for greater accuracy. The results in this article thus represent a promising development in the formalization of a framework for generation of heuristic-free turbulence closures from data.},

We consider two simple one-dimensional structural eigenvalue problems and two static shell boundary value problems modeled with trivariate NURBS solids. We also develop a local reﬁnement strategy that we utilize in one of the shell analyses. We ﬁnd that increased smoothness, that is, the ‘‘k-method,’’ leads to a signiﬁcant increase in accuracy for the problems of structural vibrations over the classical C0continuous ‘‘p-method,’’ whereas a judicious insertion of C0-continuous surfaces about singularities in a mesh otherwise generated by the k-method, usually outperforms a mesh in which all basis functions attain their maximum level of smoothness. We conclude that the potential for the k-method is high, but smoothness is an issue that is not well understood due to the historical dominance of C0-continuous ﬁnite elements and therefore further studies are warranted.},

	abstract = {The traditional method used to estimate the hydrodynamic performance of a ship uses either the model test results or one of the many empirical methods to estimate and observe the trend in fouling friction coefficient (ΔCF) over time. The biggest weakness of this method is that the model test results as well as the empirical methods used here is sometimes not well-fitted for the full-scale ship due to several reasons like scale effects and, therefore, this method may result in an inaccurate performance prediction. Moreover, in the case of a novel ship design, it would be nearly impossible to find a well-fitting empirical method. The current work establishes a new performance indicator, formulated in the form of generalized admiralty coefficient with displacement and speed exponents statistically estimated using the in-service data recorded onboard the ship itself. The current method completely removes the dependence on empirical methods or model test results for the performance prediction of ships. It is observed here that the performance predictions using the current method and the traditional method are based on the same underlying logic as well as the results obtained from both the methods are found to be in good agreement.},

	abstract = {Semantic keypoints provide concise abstractions for a variety of visual understanding tasks. Existing methods define semantic keypoints separately for each category with a fixed number of semantic labels in fixed indices. As a result, this keypoint representation is in-feasible when objects have a varying number of parts, e.g. chairs with varying number of legs. We propose a category-agnostic keypoint representation, which combines a multi-peak heatmap (StarMap) for all the keypoints and their corresponding features as 3D locations in the canonical viewpoint (CanViewFeature) defined for each instance. Our intuition is that the 3D locations of the keypoints in canonical object views contain rich semantic and compositional information. Using our flexible representation, we demonstrate competitive performance in keypoint detection and localization compared to category-specific state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we show that when augmented with an additional depth channel (DepthMap) to lift the 2D keypoints to 3D, our representation can achieve state-of-the-art results in viewpoint estimation. Finally, we show that our category-agnostic keypoint representation can be generalized to novel categories.},

	abstract = {Dynamic system models, based on partial differential equations (PDEs), are often unsuitable for direct use in control or state estimation purposes, due to the high computational cost arising from the necessity to apply sophisticated numerical methods for a solution, such as semi-discretization, also known as spatial discretization. Hence, there is often an inevitable trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency during the model reduction step to ensure real-time applicability. In this contribution, we propose a state–space model formulation, using so-called physics-informed neural networks. This modeling approach enables a highly efficient inclusion of complex physical system descriptions within the design of control or state estimation setups. The resulting state–space model does not require any numerical solution techniques during the state propagation, as each time step is based on the evaluation of a reasonably sized neural net that approximates the solution of the PDE. Thus, this approach is suitable for real-time applications of various complex dynamic systems that can be described by one or a set of PDEs. Besides the modeling approach itself, the contribution also provides an illustrative example of the state–space modeling method in the context of model predictive control, as well as state estimation with an extended Kalman filter. These methods will be applied to a system based on a numerical solution of the Burgers equation.},

We use standard continuous Q1 finite elements at a coarse discretization scale H as trial functions, whereas the test functions are computed as the solutions of local problems at a finer scale h. The diameter of the support of the test functions behaves like m H for some oversampling parameter m. Provided m is of the order of log(κ) and h is sufficiently small, the resulting method is stable and quasi-optimal in the regime where H is proportional to κ−1. In homogeneous (or more general periodic) media, the fine scale test functions depend only on local mesh-configurations. Therefore, the seemingly high cost for the computation of the test functions can be drastically reduced on structured meshes. We present numerical experiments in two and three space dimensions.},

	abstract = {Speaker recognition is a task of identifying persons from their voices. Recently, deep learning has dramatically revolutionized speaker recognition. However, there is lack of comprehensive reviews on the exciting progress. In this paper, we review several major subtasks of speaker recognition, including speaker verification, identification, diarization, and robust speaker recognition, with a focus on deep-learning-based methods. Because the major advantage of deep learning over conventional methods is its representation ability, which is able to produce highly abstract embedding features from utterances, we first pay close attention to deep-learning-based speaker feature extraction, including the inputs, network structures, temporal pooling strategies, and objective functions respectively, which are the fundamental components of many speaker recognition subtasks. Then, we make an overview of speaker diarization, with an emphasis of recent supervised, end-to-end, and online diarization. Finally, we survey robust speaker recognition from the perspectives of domain adaptation and speech enhancement, which are two major approaches of dealing with domain mismatch and noise problems. Popular and recently released corpora are listed at the end of the paper.},

	abstract = {A non-iterative method for handling the coupling of the implicitly discretised time-dependent fluid flow equations is described. The method is based on the use of pressure and velocity as dependent variables and is hence applicable to both the compressible and incompressible versions of the transport equations. The main feature of the technique is the splitting of the solution process into a series of steps whereby operations on pressure are decoupled from those on velocity at each step, with the split sets of equations being amenable to solution by standard techniques. At each time-step, the procedure yields solutions which approximate the exact solution of the difference equations. The accuracy of this splitting procedure is assessed for a linearised form of the discretised equations, and the analysis indicates that the solution yielded by it differs from the exact solution of the difference equations by terms proportional to the powers of the time-step size. By virtue of this, it is possible to dispense with iteration, thus resulting in an efficient implicit scheme while retaining simplicity of implementation relative to contemporary block simultaneous methods. This is verified in a companion paper which presents results of computations carried out using the method.},

The hierarchical type of preconditioning used in the past is extended to the SSOR and incomplete factorization type preconditioning and applied with a global handling of the stiffness matrix. The paper also presents some new ideas on Domain Decomposition (DD) matrix-handling techniques, whereby the explicit formulation of the resulting Schur complement is avoided by utilizing the PCG method with efficient preconditioners and by processing separately on the coarse and the fine mesh. The suitability of the methods to the p-version of the adaptive finite element method is demonstrated through extensive numerical tests in two dimensions.},

Engng 24, 1367–1393 (1987)] have thus far been limited to isotropic plates. The present paper removes this drawback by extending the library of the optional sets of intraelement displacement functions by a new set of Trefftz functions for orthotropic plates. The new set of trial functions yields as a special case the original isotropic functions, devised so as to preserve the desirable invariant properties of the resulting elements. Numerical examples illustrate the excellent practical efficiency of the formulation and show that the very high accuracy reported for the solution of isotropic plates is preserved for orthotropic plates.},

The described approximation is an extension of our earlier work, which was restricted to domains with separable geometry. The numerical experiments are confined to these geometrical configurations: a sphere, a (finite) cylinder, and a cylinder with spherical incaps, all within a truncating sphere. The sphere problem admits an exact solution and serves as a basis for the convergence study. Solutions to the other two problems are compared with those obtained using the boundary element method.},

Because the desire to fit this type of data is encountered frequently in many areas of scientific applications, an investigation of the available methods for solving this problem was undertaken. Several aspects, such as computational efficiency, fitting characteristics and ease of implementation,were analysed and compared. Within the context of a general-purpose method for large sets of data, two of these methods emerged as being generally superior to the others. It is the purpose of this paper to describe these two methods and present examples illustrating their use and application.},

First simulation cases with laminar flow and power law wind speed profiles were compared to the case of a uniform inflow. Secondly, a similar analysis was done for cases with direction shear. In each case, we derived a standard power curve (function of the wind speed at hub height) and power curves obtained with various definitions of equivalent wind speed in order to reduce the scatter due to shear. Thirdly, the variations of the power output and the power curve were analysed for various turbulence intensities. Furthermore, the equivalent speed method was successfully tested on a power curve resulting from simulations cases combining shear and turbulence. Finally, we roughly simulated the wind speed measurements we may get from a LIDAR mounted on the nacelle of the turbine (measuring upwind) and we investigated different ways of deriving an equivalent wind speed from such measurements.},

	abstract = {In this article we propose two simple a posteriori error estimators for solving second order elliptic problems using adaptive isogeometric analysis. The idea is based on a Serendipity1 pairing of discrete approximation spaces Shp,k(M)–Shp+1,k+1(M), where the space Shp+1,k+1(M) is considered as an enrichment of the original basis of Shp,k(M) by means of the k-refinement, a typical unique feature available in isogeometric analysis. The space Shp+1,k+1(M) is used to obtain a higher order accurate isogeometric finite element approximation and using this approximation we propose two simple a posteriori error estimators. The proposed a posteriori error based adaptive h-refinement methodology using LR B-splines is tested on classical elliptic benchmark problems. The numerical tests illustrate the optimal convergence rates obtained for the unknown, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed error estimators.},

	abstract = {The h-h/2-strategy is one well-known technique for the a posteriori error estimation for Galerkin discretizations of energy minimization problems. One considers η := φh/2 − φh to estimate the error φ − φh , where φh is a Galerkin solution with respect to a mesh Th and φh/2 is a Galerkin solution with respect to the mesh Th/2 obtained from a uniform reﬁnement of Th. This error estimator is always efﬁcient and observed to be also reliable in practice. However, for boundary element methods, the energy norm is non-local and thus the error estimator η does not provide information for a local mesh-reﬁnement. We consider Symm’s integral equation of the ﬁrst kind, where the energy space is the negative-order Sobolev space H −1/2 ( ). Recent localization techniques allow to replace the energy norm in this case by some weighted L2-norm. Then, this very basic error estimation strategy is also applicable to steer an h-adaptive algorithm. Numerical experiments in 2D and 3D show that the proposed method works well in practice. A short conclusion is concerned with other integral equations, e.g., the hypersingular case with energy space H 1/2( ) and H01/2( ), respectively, or a transmission problem.},

	abstract = {The hydrodynamic performance of a sea-going ship varies over its lifespan due to factors like marine fouling and the condition of the anti-fouling paint system. In order to accurately estimate the power demand and fuel consumption for a planned voyage, it is important to assess the hydrodynamic performance of the ship. The current work uses machine-learning (ML) methods to estimate the hydrodynamic performance of a ship using the onboard recorded in-service data. Three ML methods, NL-PCR, NL-PLSR and probabilistic ANN, are calibrated using the data from two sister ships. The calibrated models are used to extract the varying trend in ship’s hydrodynamic performance over time and predict the change in performance through several propeller and hull cleaning events. The predicted change in performance is compared with the corresponding values estimated using the fouling friction coefficient (ΔCF). The ML methods are found to be performing well while modeling the hydrodynamic state of the ships with probabilistic ANN model performing the best, but the results from NL-PCR and NL-PLSR are not far behind, indicating that it may be possible to use simple methods to solve such problems with the help of domain knowledge.},

In this study, we present a self-organising map (SOM) based approach to predict which bank accounts are possibly involved in money laundering cases, given their financial transaction histories. Our method takes advantage of the competitive and adaptive properties of SOM to represent the accounts in a lower-dimensional space. Subsequently, categorising the SOM and the accounts into money laundering risk levels and proposing investigative strategies enables us to measure the classification performance. Our results indicate that our framework is well capable of identifying suspicious accounts already investigated by our partner bank, using both proposed investigation strategies. We further validate our model by analysing the performance when modifying different parameters in our dataset.},

	abstract = {Isogeometric boundary element method is a computer simulation algorithm that can directly utilize the data of a geometric model represented by its surface. Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces are a widely used technique in 3D computer graphics to construct complicated geometries. In the present work, we combine Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces with isogeometric boundary element method to simulate acoustic propagation in semiinfinite domains. The present method can produce fast and high fidelity results, due to its strength of seamless integration of computer-aided geometric modeling and numerical simulation. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by several acoustic scattering problems, including the one with analytical solutions and the examples with complicated geometries.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model was developed to predict the scattering of a plane acoustic wave from an elastic spherical shell with different fluid media inside and out. The model was developed from the more convenient standpoint of elastic theory rather than from the acoustic point of view. Resulting equations were solved in terms of known functions. Matrix methods were used throughout. A numerical method is presented that takes advantage of some peculiarities of the resulting matrix and is appropriate to computer implementation. Some results of a computer program for the spherical shell are given. A few limiting cases of the exact solutions are compared with previously reported results.},

First, the concepts behind isogeometric analysis are brieﬂy reviewed. The effect of perturbing control points upon the geometrical mapping is observed in the one-dimensional setting. The concept is extended to multiple dimensions with a series of cases where the interior of a cube is distorted in different ways and patch tests are performed to assess accuracy. A circular ﬁllet patch is introduced through the appropriate degeneration of a control mesh in order to address the problem of modeling small features in ﬁnite element models. The ﬁllet patch is tested with two problems of linear elasticity and is shown to be accurate. The investigation is further extended to the setting of large-deformation nearly incompressible nonlinear elasticity with two examples which make use of the recently proposed F projection method.},

	abstract = {This paper is about a curious phenomenon. Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component. Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the L1 norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces.},

	abstract = {Autonomous systems are becoming ubiquitous and gaining momentum within the marine sector. Since the electrification of transport is happening simultaneously, autonomous marine vessels can reduce environmental impact, lower costs, and increase efficiency. Although close monitoring is still required to ensure safety, the ultimate goal is full autonomy. One major milestone is to develop a control system that is versatile enough to handle any weather and encounter that is also robust and reliable. Additionally, the control system must adhere to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) for successful interaction with human sailors. Since the COLREGs were written for the human mind to interpret, they are written in ambiguous prose and therefore not machine-readable or verifiable. Due to these challenges and the wide variety of situations to be tackled, classical model-based approaches prove complicated to implement and computationally heavy. Within machine learning (ML), deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential for a wide range of applications. The model-free and self-learning properties of DRL make it a promising candidate for autonomous vessels. In this work, a subset of the COLREGs is incorporated into a DRL-based path following and obstacle avoidance system using collision risk theory. The resulting autonomous agent dynamically interpolates between path following and COLREG-compliant collision avoidance in the training scenario, isolated encounter situations, and AIS-based simulations of real-world scenarios.},

	abstract = {Computational simulation can be deﬁned as any computer application which involves the numerical solution to a system of partial diﬀerential equations. In this paper, a broad overview is given of veriﬁcation procedures for computational simulation. The two aspects of veriﬁcation examined are code veriﬁcation and solution veriﬁcation. Code veriﬁcation is a set of procedures developed to ﬁnd coding mistakes that aﬀect the numerical discretization. The method of manufactured solutions combined with order of accuracy veriﬁcation is recommended for code veriﬁcation, and this procedure is described in detail. Solution veriﬁcation is used to estimate the numerical errors that occur in every computational simulation. Both round-oﬀ and iterative convergence errors are discussed, and a posteriori methods for estimating the discretization error are examined. Emphasis is placed on discretization error estimation methods based on Richardson extrapolation as they are equally applicable to any numerical method. Additional topics covered include calculating the observed order of accuracy, error bands, and practical aspects of mesh reﬁnement.},

A software correction algorithm was developed to remove the effects of sea conditions resulting in system motions from the recorded lidar data. The final performance of the system was verified in a measurement campaign next to the offshore meteorological mast FINO1 in the German North Sea. Both the results of an accuracy assessment and a more detailed sensitivity analysis of the floating-lidar performance with respect to different external parameters were performed. For the recorded horizontal mean wind speeds a very good measurement performance with an R2-value of 0.996 is achieved even when no motion correction is applied. To use the turbulence intensity and wind direction data from the system, the application of a motion correction is necessary. The overall System Availability for the nine-weeks-measurement period was derived as 98\%.},

	abstract = {Real cities are comprised of a diverse, random arrangement of building positions, shapes, and sizes. Yet most of the urban parameterisations thus far developed share the assumption that a city is made up of either a regular array of parallelepipeds or infinitely long canopies. The inputs to these models, which include street width, building width, building density and a statistical representation of building heights, are generally obtained through quantitative field surveys (which are very slow and time consuming to perform) or qualitative estimates from Digital Elevation Model. But in performing this geometric abstraction there is no way to ensure that the total built surfaces and volumes of the simplified geometry match those of the actual city, or more importantly, that the energy and momentum exchanges are equivalent. In this paper, we aim to test the central hypothesis that cities can be accurately represented by a regular array of parallelepipeds or canopies. For this, we investigate, for a particular scenario, the effects of complexity in urban geometry on the spatially averaged drag forces and shortwave radiation exchange. For drag computation, we used the Immersed Surface Technique, while for computing the incident radiation we used the Simplified Radiosity Algorithm. After testing the above hypothesis, we propose a new approach for fitting an array of cubes to any complex (realistic) geometry, so that new or existing urban parameterisation schemes can be used with confidence.

	abstract = {Developing surrogate geophysical models from data is a key research topic in atmospheric and oceanic modeling because of the large computational costs associated with numerical simulation methods. Researchers have started applying a wide range of machine learning models, in particular neural networks, to geophysical data for forecasting without these constraints. Constructing neural networks for forecasting such data is nontrivial, however, and often requires trial and error. To address these limitations, we focus on developing proper-orthogonaldecomposition-based long short-term memory networks (PODLSTMs). We develop a scalable neural architecture search for generating stacked LSTMs to forecast temperature in the NOAA Optimum Interpolation Sea-Surface Temperature data set. Our approach identiﬁes POD-LSTMs that are superior to manually designed variants and baseline time-series prediction methods. We also assess the scalability of different architecture search strategies on up to 512 Intel Knights Landing nodes of the Theta supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility.},

Here further numerical experiments are given which also include error estimators for the vector-valued problem of plane elastostatics and implementations for h-adaptive grids of triangles and quadrilaterals which are constructed using an algorithm of equidistribution of error coupled with h-refinement or h-remeshing schemes. A detailed numerical study of several flux-projectors for h-adaptive grids of bilinear and biquadratic quadrilaterals is conducted; a flux equilibration iteration, which may be employed in some cases to improve flux projection estimates, is also included. FAor the case of grids of quadrilaterals, several versions of the element residual estimators, which differ by the approximate flux employed for the calculation of the boundary integral term in the definition of the local problems, are compared. The numerical experiments confirm the good overall performance of residual estimates and indicate that flux projection estimates, which are now operational in several commercial codes, may be divergent when they are employed to estimate the error in even order h-adaptive approximations.},

	abstract = {Sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation, a workshop on the boundary element method (BEM) was held on the campus of the University of Akron during September 1–3, 2010 (NSF, 2010, “Workshop on the Emerging Applications and Future Directions of the Boundary Element Method,” University of Akron, Ohio, September 1–3). This paper was prepared after this workshop by the organizers and participants based on the presentations and discussions at the workshop. The paper aims to review the major research achievements in the last decade, the current status, and the future directions of the BEM in the next decade. The review starts with a brief introduction to the BEM. Then, new developments in Green's functions, symmetric Galerkin formulations, boundary meshfree methods, and variationally based BEM formulations are reviewed. Next, fast solution methods for efficiently solving the BEM systems of equations, namely, the fast multipole method, the pre-corrected fast Fourier transformation method, and the adaptive cross approximation method are presented. Emerging applications of the BEM in solving microelectromechanical systems, composites, functionally graded materials, fracture mechanics, acoustic, elastic and electromagnetic waves, time-domain problems, and coupled methods are reviewed. Finally, future directions of the BEM as envisioned by the authors for the next five to ten years are discussed. This paper is intended for students, researchers, and engineers who are new in BEM research and wish to have an overview of the field. Technical details of the BEM and related approaches discussed in the review can be found in the Reference section with more than 400 papers cited in this review.},

Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated design process, which is predicated on a NURBS-based CAD environment as well as on the NURBS-based isogeometric analysis, and substantiates in a mechanical point of view. The presented investigations are concentrated on thin-walled structures. In this paper several issues, e.g. continuity conditions associated with the applied ﬁnite element type, arising from the increased challenges for the geometric modelling within an integrated design process are identiﬁed and solution strategies are discussed. Furthermore, general analysis-aware modelling guidelines are derived. The paper concludes by exemplifying the complete integrated structural design process for a structural part.},

Here we consider this matrix to represent the development of a spatial grid through time e.g. data from a static video source. DMD was originally introduced in the fluid mechanics community, but is also suitable for motion detection in video streams and its use for background subtraction has received little previous investigation. In this study we present a comprehensive evaluation of background subtraction, using the randomized DMD and compare the results with leading robust principal component analysis algorithms. The results are convincing and show the random DMD is an efficient and powerful approach for background modeling, allowing processing of high resolution videos in real-time. Supplementary materials include implementations of the algorithms in Python.},

	abstract = {Increasing product variety and shortening product lifecycles require a fast and inexpensive reconfiguration of existing manufacturing systems. A synchronized Digital Twin of the manufacturing system is one solution to face these challenges. In order to use the Digital Twin for reconfiguration, a major challenge is to keep the developed Digital Twin of a manufacturing system, which was created during the engineering process, synchronized with the real system after commissioning. To automatically synchronize the cross-domain models of a Digital Twin after the commissioning of a manufacturing system, the authors introduced the Anchor-Point-Method in their previous papers. In this paper, the realization of the Anchor-Point-Method based on an assistance system is presented and the functionality is evaluated. This assistance system enables having an up-to-date Digital Twin of a manufacturing system available during the entire life-cycle of a system. Finally, a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the advantages of a synchronized Digital Twin for the reconfiguration of a manufacturing system is presented. For this purpose, an automated system has been digitally and physically designed and built. On this system, a reconfiguration using the synchronized Digital Twin was performed and compared with another reconfiguration without Digital Twin collected through a survey. The results show that the Digital Twin can reduce the time of the reconfiguration process by up to 58 percent.},

A quadrature strategy is developed which gives rise to a fully discrete scheme preserving the exponential convergence of the -Boundary Element Method.

We show that the asymptotic behaviour of the integral depends on the integrand and its derivatives at the singular point of the integrand, the stationary points and the endpoints of the integral. A truncated asymptotic expansion achieves an error that decays faster for increasing frequency. Based on the asymptotic analysis, a Filon-type method is constructed to approximate the integral. Unlike the asymptotic method, the Filon method achieves high accuracy for both small ω and large ω. The complex-valued quadrature involves interpolation at the zeros of polynomials orthogonal to a complex weight function. Numerical results indicate that the complexvalued Gaussian quadrature achieves the highest accuracy when the three methods are compared.},

	abstract = {Deep learning frameworks have often focused on either usability or speed, but not both. PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it was designed from first principles to support an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs.
In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance.
We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several commonly used benchmarks.},

In recent years, machine learning has offered a renaissance to the fluid community due to the rapid developments in data science, processing units, neural network based technologies, and sensor adaptations. So far in many applications in fluid dynamics, machine learning approaches have been mostly focused on a standard process that requires centralizing the training data on a designated machine or in a data center. In this article, we present a federated machine learning approach that enables localized clients to collaboratively learn an aggregated and shared predictive model while keeping all the training data on each edge device. We demonstrate the feasibility and prospects of such a decentralized learning approach with an effort to forge a deep learning surrogate model for reconstructing spatiotemporal fields. Our results indicate that federated machine learning might be a viable tool for designing highly accurate predictive decentralized digital twins relevant to fluid dynamics.},

Here, we present the development of the logical companion to that element, viz. an oblate spheroidal infinite element. Both elements are based on multipole expansions for the acoustic field in spheroidalcoordinatesdevelopedby the second author in a separate paper, recently submitted for publication. For completeness, an outline of the proofs of convergence of these expansions is included here. Also, essential equations for the previously published prolate spheroidal infinite element are reproduced here in order that this paper can stand as an independent explication of the spheroidal family of infinite elements. It is shown that a choice of prolate or ablate spheroidal infinite elements provides a capability for very efficiently modeling acoustic fields surrounding structures with a wide variety of practical shapes. 0 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.},

	abstract = {In this paper, along with the progress of modern wind energy technology, the trends of wind energy technology and potential challenges have been studied thoroughly. It is estimated that within the next 2–3 decades, the Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) can dominate the wind-energy technology. The VAWT requires less land space and using the same space; it is capable of producing more wind energy than that of its counterpart. By implying the Fish Schooling Concept effectively and successfully, it is possible to advance the wind-energy technology more. In the last 3–4 decades, the wind turbine capacity has been increased around 30–40 times. With the increase of wind energy capacity, the demand of the energy storage system has been increased significantly. Along with the many energy storage systems, fuel cells and batteries are the two most promising devices to meet the demand in RE systems. The wind-energy technology is established itself but not yet fully mature and hence there are many areas where improvements are required to reduce the cost of wind energy.},

The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 × 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2–4\%, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion. The Preliminary Reference Earth Model, PREM, and auxiliary tables showing fits to the data are presented.},

	abstract = {Although there are many locations suitable to construct new wind turbines, wind speeds in those areas are not always available, which makes it difficult to plan and develop a proper wind energy conversion system. This paper proposes an approach to determine the wind speeds corresponding to locations without any past wind speed data. First, monthly mean wind speed was modeled as a function of geographical variables (latitude, longitude and elevation), atmospheric variables (ambient temperature, atmospheric pressure, percent relative humidity), and the month of the year for a case location (Aegean Region of Turkey) by artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained by the data supplied by 55 wind speed measuring stations throughout the region (660 data points). Then, the prediction ability of the ANN model was tested: The wind speed data of each station was excluded from the database, and an ANN model trained by the data of the rest of the wind stations was used to forecast the excluded data. Finally, a grid search algorithm was applied to the entire region to search for the optimum location for the maximum average annual wind speed which was found to be 10.6 m/s. A generic wind turbine was considered at this location and a power of 1.79 MW was achieved.},

When starting from a tensor-mesh this reﬁnement process builds what we denote an LR-mesh, a special instance of a box-mesh. On the LR-mesh we obtain a collection of hierarchically scaled Bsplines, denoted LR B-splines, that forms a nonnegative partition of unity and spans the complete piecewise polynomial space on the mesh when the mesh construction follows certain simple rules. The dimensionality of the spline space can be determined using some recent dimension formulas.},

The problem is challenging due to the variety of objects as well as the complexity of a scene caused by clutter and occlusions between objects. In this work, we introduce PoseCNN, a new Convolutional Neural Network for 6D object pose estimation. PoseCNN estimates the 3D translation of an object by localizing its center in the image and predicting its distance from the camera. The 3D rotation of the object is estimated by regressing to a quaternion representation. We also introduce a novel loss function that enables PoseCNN to handle symmetric objects. In addition, we contribute a large scale video dataset for 6D object pose estimation named the YCB-Video dataset. Our dataset provides accurate 6D poses of 21 objects from the YCB dataset observed in 92 videos with 133,827 frames. We conduct extensive experiments on our YCB-Video dataset and the OccludedLINEMOD dataset to show that PoseCNN is highly robust to occlusions, can handle symmetric objects, and provide accurate pose estimation using only color images as input. When using depth data to further refine the poses, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging OccludedLINEMOD dataset. Our code and dataset are available at https://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/projects/posecnn/.},

	abstract = {Most deep pose estimation methods need to be trained for specific object instances or categories. In this work we propose a completely generic deep pose estimation approach, which does not require the network to have been trained on relevant categories, nor objects in a category to have a canonical pose. We believe this is a crucial step to design robotic systems that can interact with new objects in the wild not belonging to a predefined category. Our main insight is to dynamically condition pose estimation with a representation of the 3D shape of the target object. More precisely, we train a Convolutional Neural Network that takes as input both a test image and a 3D model, and outputs the relative 3D pose of the object in the input image with respect to the 3D model. We demonstrate that our method boosts performances for supervised category pose estimation on standard benchmarks, namely Pascal3D+, ObjectNet3D and Pix3D, on which we provide results superior to the state of the art. More importantly, we show that our network trained on everyday man-made objects from ShapeNet generalizes without any additional training to completely new types of 3D objects by providing results on the LINEMOD dataset as well as on natural entities such as animals from ImageNet.},

	abstract = {It is well known that Galerkin finite element methods suffer from pollution error when solving wave problems. To reduce the pollution impact on the solution different approaches were proposed to enrich the finite element method with wave-like functions so that the exact wavenumber is incorporated into the finite element approximation space. Solving wave problems with isogeometric analysis was also investigated in the literature where the superior behaviour of isogeometric analysis due to higher continuity in the underlying basis has been studied. Recently, a plane wave enriched isogeometric analysis was introduced for acoustic problems. However, it remains unquantified the impact of these different approaches on the pollution or how they perform compared to each other. In this work, we show that isogeometric analysis outperforms finite element method in dealing with pollution. We observe similar behaviour when both the methods are enriched with plane waves. Using higher order polynomials with fewer enrichment functions seems to improve the pollution compared to lower order polynomials with more functions. However, the latter still leads to smaller errors using similar number of degrees of freedom. In conclusion, we propose that partition of unity isogeometric analysis can be an efficient tool for wave problems as enrichment eliminates the need for domain re-meshing at higher frequencies and also due to its ability to capture the exact geometry even on coarse meshes as well as its improved pollution behaviour.},

In Case (a), 600 individuals are initially distributed over 20 subpopulations and evolve over 3000 generations. Case (b) has 600 individuals spread over 20 subpopulations initially and evolves for 3000 generations. Case (c) starts with 600 individuals spread over 20 subpopulations and evolves for 2500 generations. In addition to optimal configurations, results include fitness, total power output, efficiency of power output and number of turbines for each configuration. Disagreement with the results of an earlier study is observed and a possible explanation is provided.},

First, we present Pix3D, a large-scale benchmark of diverse image-shape pairs with pixel-level 2D-3D alignment. Pix3D has wide applications in shape-related tasks including reconstruction, retrieval, viewpoint estimation, etc. Building such a large-scale dataset, however, is highly challenging; existing datasets either contain only synthetic data, or lack precise alignment between 2D images and 3D shapes, or only have a small number of images. Second, we calibrate the evaluation criteria for 3D shape reconstruction through behavioral studies, and use them to objectively and systematically benchmark cutting-edge reconstruction algorithms on Pix3D. Third, we design a novel model that simultaneously performs 3D reconstruction and pose estimation; our multi-task learning approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tasks.},

	abstract = {Estimating the 6D pose of objects using only RGB images remains challenging because of problems such as occlusion and symmetries. It is also difficult to construct 3D models with precise texture without expert knowledge or specialized scanning devices. To address these problems, we propose a novel pose estimation method, Pix2Pose, that predicts the 3D coordinates of each object pixel without textured models. An auto-encoder architecture is designed to estimate the 3D coordinates and expected errors per pixel. These pixel-wise predictions are then used in multiple stages to form 2D-3D correspondences to directly compute poses with the PnP algorithm with RANSAC iterations. Our method is robust to occlusion by leveraging recent achievements in generative adversarial training to precisely recover occluded parts. Furthermore, a novel loss function, the transformer loss, is proposed to handle symmetric objects by guiding predictions to the closest symmetric pose. Evaluations on three different benchmark datasets containing symmetric and occluded objects show our method outperforms the state of the art using only RGB images.},

However, it is difficult to train these models on complex dynamical systems from data alone due to their low data efficiency and sensitivity to hyperparameters and initialisation. This work demonstrates that injection of partially known information at an intermediate layer in a DNN can improve model accuracy, reduce model uncertainty, and yield improved convergence during the training. The value of these physics-guided neural networks has been demonstrated by learning the dynamics of a wide variety of nonlinear dynamical systems represented by five well-known equations in nonlinear systems theory: the Lotka–Volterra, Duffing, Van der Pol, Lorenz, and Henon–Heiles systems.},

In this Letter, we introduce a modular physics guided machine learning framework to improve the accuracy of such data-driven predictive engines. The chief idea in our approach is to augment the knowledge of the simplified theories with the underlying learning process. To emphasize their physical importance, our architecture consists of adding certain features at intermediate layers rather than in the input layer. To demonstrate our approach, we select a canonical airfoil aerodynamic problem with the enhancement of the potential flow theory. We include the features obtained by a panel method that can be computed efficiently for an unseen configuration in our training procedure. By addressing the generalizability concerns, our results suggest that the proposed feature enhancement approach can be effectively used in many scientific machine learning applications, especially for the systems where we can use a theoretical, empirical, or simplified model to guide the learning module.},

First, image processing techniques, such as contrast enhancement, ﬁltering, classiﬁcation, and segmentation, are used to improve the quality of the input imaging data. Then, luminal surfaces are extracted by isocontouring the preprocessed data, followed by the extraction of vascular skeleton via Voronoi and Delaunay diagrams. Next, the skeleton-based sweeping method is used to construct hexahedral control meshes. Templates are designed for various branching conﬁgurations to decompose the geometry into mapped meshable patches. Each patch is then meshed using one-to-one sweeping techniques, and boundary vertices are projected to the luminal surface. Finally, hexahedral solid NURBS are constructed and used in isogeometric analysis of blood ﬂow. Piecewise linear hexahedral meshes can also be obtained using this approach. Examples of patientspeciﬁc arterial models are presented.},

The PGD framework is applied for the first time to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the turbulent regime, to compute a generalised solution for velocity, pressure and turbulent viscosity, explicitly depending on the design parameters of the problem. In order to simulate flows of industrial interest, a minimally intrusive implementation based on OpenFOAM SIMPLE algorithm applied to the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model is devised. The resulting PGD strategy is applied to parametric flow control problems and achieves both qualitative and quantitative agreement with the full order OpenFOAM solution for convection-dominated fully-developed turbulent incompressible flows, with Reynolds number up to one million.},

	abstract = {Recharge mileage is of great importance for a hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle. High pressure hydrogen storage can increase the recharge mileage signiﬁcantly. Before hydrogen ﬂows into the fuel cell, a decompression process is necessary. To overcome the seal of the piping system and realize the decompression, Tesla valve can be well used, since it is a type of check valve without moving parts, and when there is a reverse ﬂow, large pressure drop appears between the inlet and outlet. In order to obtain a better pressure drop performance for a Tesla valve, in this paper, the structural parameters including the hydraulic diameter, the valve angle, and the inner curve radius are investigated for a large range of inlet velocities. The results indicate that a small hydraulic diameter and small inner curve radius but large valve angle can provide a higher pressure drop under a large inlet velocity, while the pressure drop under different structural parameters barely changes under a small inlet velocity (less than 100 m/s). Besides, there is a low-pressure zone behind the outlet of the bend channel, which should be paid attention. This work can be referred by the further applications of Tesla valves in hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles for hydrogen decompression.},

-version of the finite element for solving two-dimensional elliptic partial differential equations on a shared-memory parallel computer are studied. For a collection of benchmark problems, the costs in CPU time of various individual subtasks performed by the finite element solver are systematically examined, including construction of local stiffness matrices, elimination of unknowns associated with element interiors, and global solution on element interfaces by a preconditioned conjugate gradient method. General observations are that the costs of the “naturally” parallel computations associated with local elements are significantly higher than any global computations, so that the latter do not represent a significant bottleneck to parallel efficiency. However, memory conflicts place some limitations on the sizes or number of local problems that can be handled efficiently in parallel.},

The element geometry is defined by the coordinates of the nodes located on its middle surface and nodal vectors describing the bottom and top surfaces of the element. The element displacement approximation can be of arbitrary and different polynomial orders in the plane of the element and in the transverse direction. The element approximation functions and the corresponding nodal variables are derived from the Lagrange family of interpolation functions. The resulting approximation functions and the nodal variables are hierarchical and the element displacement approximation ensures C° continuity. The element properties are established using the principle of virtual work and the hierarchical element approximation. In formulating the properties of the element complete three dimensional stresses and strains are considered, hence the element is equally effective for very thin as well as extremely thick shells and plates. Incremental equations of equilibrium are derived and solved using the standard Newton–Raphson method. The total load is divided into increments, and for each increment of load, equilibrium iterations are performed until each component of the residuals is within a preset tolerance. Numerical examples are presented to show the accuracy, efficiency and advantages of the present formulation.

The approximation functions and the corresponding nodal variables for the beam element are derived by first constructing the hierarchical one dimensional approximation functions of orders pξ and pη, and the corresponding hierarchical nodal variable operators for each of the two directions ξ and η and then taking their product. This procedure yields approximation functions and nodal variables for the curved beam element that correspond to polynomial orders pξ and pη in ξ and η directions. The element approximation is hierarchical, i.e. the approximation functions and the nodal variables are both hierarchical. Thus, the element matrix and the load vectors corresponding to the polynomial orders pξ and pη are a subset of those corresponding to the polynomial orders (pξ + 1) and (pη + 1). The element formulation ensures C0 continuity. The element properties are derived using the principle of virtual work and the hierarchical element displacement approximation. The element geometry is constructed using the coordinates of the nodes located on the elastic axis of the element and the node point vectors indicating nodal depths and the element width at the nodes. The orders of approximation along the length of the element as well as in the transverse direction can be chosen independently to obtain optimum (maximum) rate of convergence.

In developing the element properties all four components of the stress (σθ, σr,τrz, σz) and strain (εθ, εr, γrz, εz) are retained, i.e. the stress normal to the middle surface of the element is not neglected (an assumption commonly used in developing axisymmetric shell elements) in the present formulation. The element formulation also permits non-differentiable geometries (sharp corners). The stress concentrations at such locations can be calculated accurately due to the presence of a complete state of stress (and strain) and a non-differentiable geometry feature.

The element formulation permits isotropic as well as generally orthotropic material properties. The formulation allows distributed heat flux, convective boundaries and internal heat generation.

	isbn = {1-5090-5284-4},
	abstract = {A wind turbine blade is capital equipment vital enough to be protected and maintained for inherent safety and reliability during lifetime due to its high impact on turbine availability in event of failure / repair. Unlike matured industries like aerospace, there are no specific guidelines for maintenance plans and mostly the repairs are reactive in nature. This leads to very high cost of maintenance owing to longer downtime of the turbine raising a need to derive an effective maintenance strategy demanding reliability centered maintenance, also facilitating business decisions on spares, service and maintenance requirements through use of available field information, supported by a predictive analytics and reliability models with an overall objective of reducing the operation cost and gaining higher levels of reliability. This paper is an attempt to make use of the widely practiced Predictive Analytics techniques in wind domain to address such challenges and remain competitive in the market. The model built was able to take inputs from different stages of the product life cycle providing a mathematical relationship with respect to failures and contributing factors, allowing addressing the blades that are in critical need of inspection and maintenance at any given point of time based on the rate of wear out. This further becomes a critical input for maintenance planning thereby reducing the operational cost and also attaining high levels of Reliability. Additionally, the model built also provides feedback to the different stages of blade life cycle in terms of setting targets that are required in order to maintain a certain level of Reliability in the field.},

With the proposed method, a 2km×2km wind farm with flat terrain under three wind scenarios is planned to yield the lowest unit cost per power output. Comparing with the optimized results from previous studies, lower cost can be obtained from the proposed method. The proposed method also shows high convergence stability and efficiency regarding different dense grid configurations. The algorithm is therefore particularly suitable for siting of wind turbines in a highly dense grid. Besides, the proposed algorithm has been prepared with good adaptability and it can be adapted easily for solving optimization problems in different engineering studies.},

	abstract = {Wind turbine gearbox has a high failure frequency and downtime, and therefore, several sensors are installed to perform condition monitoring to reduce the operation and maintenance costs. A gearbox can have infinite sensor nodal positions, but, in reality, the positioning of sensors is limited to a finite number of locations. Also, sensor location influences the quality of the data captured by the sensors, which is of key importance in a condition monitoring system. Hence selection of optimal sensor placement (OSP) is a challenging task which needs to be addressed. When the sensor type changes, the measurement response changes, and hence the OSP methodologies based on the measured responses may not work well. For addressing this, an optimization method based on statistical features is proposed to find the optimum sensor placement (OSP). In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a laboratory scale model of wind turbine gearbox considering multi-component faults and an integrated condition monitoring scheme. Variational mode decomposition and the Spearmen correlation coefficient are used to processes raw acoustic and vibration signals. Feature extraction is performed to obtain nine statistical features, and a mathematical objective function is constructed as a function of these features. Grey wolf optimizer is employed to find the optimal values of the statistical features. Fault classification is performed using Random forest (RF) and deep multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. Optimal sensor network identified by the above method reported classification accuracy of 86.88\% and 88.34\% for RF and MLP, respectively. As a result, the number of sensors reduced from eight to five. The proposed method can be used as an effective technique for OSP problems.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an optimal sensor placement (OSP) framework for parameter estimation, virtual sensing, and condition monitoring using information theory. The framework uses a Bayesian OSP method combined with modal expansion to minimize the information entropy about quantities of interest (QoI), such as strain time histories at critical locations of the structure, without the knowledge of input excitation. The proposed optimization framework also accounts for variations in sensor installation cost at different locations on the monitored structure. The framework is evaluated numerically using a realistic model of an offshore wind turbine on a jacket support structure under installation cost assumptions and considering information entropy of the QoI. The QoI in this numerical study are considered to be the strain time history at one or more locations on the support structure in one problem and the parameters of the structure in the other. A correlation length is considered to account for the spatial correlation of data between adjacent sensors. Effects of the correlation length and input loads on the OSP results for parameter estimation are studied. The considered structural parameters for estimation in this study include (1) modulus of elasticity of tower elements (tower stiffness), (2) modulus of elasticity of jacket elements (jacket stiffness), and (3) vertical foundation spring (soil stiffness). The effect of a subjective weight between the information entropy and sensor configuration cost on the OSP results is also investigated. Different optimal designs are achieved for different weight factors, and the Pareto solutions for OSP are presented. It is found that the OSP framework is an effective tool for decision-makers considering the cost of instrumentation. The presented Pareto optimal solutions can give insight into the value of OSP given a limited budget.},

	abstract = {Smooth spline functions such as B-splines and NURBS are already an established technology in the field of computer-aided design (CAD) and have in recent years been given a lot of attention from the computer-aided engineering (CAE) community. The advantages of local refinement are obvious for anyone working in either field, and as such, several approaches have been proposed. Among others, we find the three strategies Classical Hierarchical B-splines, Truncated Hierarchical B-splines and Locally Refined B-splines. We will in this paper present these three frameworks and highlight similarities and differences between them. In particular, we will look at the function space they span and the support of the basis functions. We will then analyse the corresponding stiffness and mass matrices in terms of sparsity patterns and conditioning numbers. We show that the basis functions in general do not span the same space, and that conditioning numbers are comparable. Moreover we show that the weighting needed by the Classical Hierarchical basis to maintain partition of unity has significant implications on the conditioning numbers.},

The accuracy of this method improves as the frequency of oscillations increases.

	abstract = {We consider the integration of one-dimensional highly oscillatory functions. Based on analytic continuation, rapidly converging quadrature rules are derived for a general class of oscillatory integrals with an analytic integrand. The accuracy of the quadrature increases both for the case of a ﬁxed number of points and increasing frequency, and for the case of an increasing number of points and ﬁxed frequency. These results are then used to obtain quadrature rules for more general oscillatory integrals, i.e., for functions that exhibit some smoothness but that are not analytic. The approach described in this paper is related to the steepest descent method, but it does not employ asymptotic expansions. It can be used for small or moderate frequencies as well as for very high frequencies. The approach is compared with the oscillatory integration techniques recently developed by Iserles and Nørsett.},

	abstract = {In this article, several discontinuous Petrov–Galerkin (DPG) methods with perfectly matched layers (PMLs) are derived along with their quasi-optimal graph test norms. Ultimately, two different complex coordinate stretching strategies are considered in these derivations. Unlike with classical formulations used by Bubnov–Galerkin methods, with so-called ultraweak variational formulations, these two strategies in fact deliver different formulations in the PML region. One of the strategies, which is argued to be more physically natural, is employed for numerically solving two- and three-dimensional time-harmonic acoustic, elastic, and electromagnetic wave propagation problems, deﬁned in unbounded domains. Through these numerical experiments, efﬁcacy of the new DPG methods with PMLs is veriﬁed.},

	abstract = {The h-p method for solving partial differential equations uses discretizations where the grid size h and the polynomial degree p are varied to obtain the most efficiency in the computing of approximate solutions. It has been known for many years that increasing p can dramatically improve efficiency and that the current common practice of keeping p = 1 is a particularly poor choice. For problems with singularities, good efficiency requires that the grid be refined near the points with singularities so the h-p method also requires a grid refinement scheme. We compare two such schemes here which we call E-Refinement (proposed by Babuska and colleagues recently) and Q-Refinement (proposed by Rice in the 1960's). Both of these schemes have been shown to have asymptotically optimal order of convergence. The actual behaviours of these two schemes are quite different in practice and the mechanisms for choosing good values of h, p and the grid refinement parameters are also quite different. This paper presents the results of a systematic experimental study of these two methods and discusses the difficulty of choosing highly efficient h, p and grid refinement parameters. Our study confirms that these two refinements are of approximately equal efficiency given such good choices. The data suggest that the Q-Refinement is more efficient but the advantage is not dramatic given the uncertainties inherent in choosing numerical methods for practical applications. We conclude that it is substantially simpler to make good choices for the Q-Refinement than for the E-Refinement.},

The integrand for the normal derivative of the ﬁeld from a double-layer density is expanded in powers of a function of θ , φ and the distance z from S. The singularities are contained in the initial terms and give rise to the one-dimensional integral in the limit z → 0+. The remainder is regular, in the limit equal to the hypersingular integrand with θ −2 and θ −1 terms removed. The decomposition is used to solve a standard and a hypersingular BIE for acoustic scattering, by identical high-order discretizations.

However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than the number of measurements taken. We present a theoretical framework in which we define DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator. This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational efficiency and mitigate the effects of noise, respectively. We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not considered in the existing literature, but can be understood using our more general framework. In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory. It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identification method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science. We show that under certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.},

The developed framework introduces an increased level of detail characterizing the impact that the wind farm layout can have on the levelized cost of energy by modelling the wind farm’s electrical infrastructure, annual energy production, and cost as functions of the wind farm layout. Using this framework, this paper explores the application of a particle swarm optimizer to the wind farm layout optimization problem considering three different levels of wind farm constraint faced by modern wind farm developers. The particle swarm optimizer is found to yield improvements in the layout with respect to the levelized cost of energy for the three benchmark cases when compared to two past studies. This highlights both applicability of the particle swarm optimizer to the problem and the ways in which a wind farm developer could make use of the present framework in the development and design of future wind farms.},

Objects in the 2D images in our database are aligned with the 3D shapes, and the alignment provides both accurate 3D pose annotation and the closest 3D shape annotation for each 2D object. Consequently, our database is useful for recognizing the 3D pose and 3D shape of objects from 2D images. We also provide baseline experiments on four tasks: region proposal generation, 2D object detection, joint 2D detection and 3D object pose estimation, and image-based 3D shape retrieval, which can serve as baselines for future research using our database.

The advantage over standard ﬁnite element discretizations is that rotating components may be introduced into a stationary ﬂow domain without geometric incompatibility. Although geometric compatibility is exactly achieved, the discretization of the ﬂow velocity and pressure remains incompatible at the interface between the stationary and rotating subdomains. This incompatibility is handled by using a weak enforcement of the continuity of solution ﬁelds at the interface of the stationary and rotating subdomains.},

	abstract = {In this article we describe recent progress on the design, analysis and implementation of hybrid numerical-asymptotic boundary integral methods for boundary value problems for the Helmholtz equation that model time harmonic acoustic wave scattering in domains exterior to impenetrable obstacles. These hybrid methods combine conventional piecewise polynomial approximations with high-frequency asymptotics to build basis functions suitable for representing the oscillatory solutions. They have the potential to solve scattering problems accurately in a computation time that is (almost) independent of frequency and this has been realized for many model problems. The design and analysis of this class of methods requires new results on the analysis and numerical analysis of highly oscillatory boundary integral operators and on the high-frequency asymptotics of scattering problems. The implementation requires the development of appropriate quadrature rules for highly oscillatory integrals. This article contains a historical account of the development of this currently very active field, a detailed account of recent progress and, in addition, a number of original research results on the design, analysis and implementation of these methods.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the pollution effect, and explores the feasibility of a local spectral method, the discrete singular convolution (DSC) algorithm for solving the Helmholtz equation with high wavenumbers. Fourier analysis is employed to study the dispersive error of the DSC algorithm. Our analysis of dispersive errors indicates that the DSC algorithm yields a dispersion vanishing scheme. The dispersion analysis is further conﬁrmed by the numerical results. For one- and higher-dimensional Helmholtz equations, the DSC algorithm is shown to be an essentially pollution-free scheme. Furthermore, for large-scale computation, the grid density of the DSC algorithm can be close to the optimal two grid points per wavelength. The present study reveals that the DSC algorithm is accurate and efﬁcient for solving the Helmholtz equation with high wavenumbers. Copyright ᭧ 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A new growing RBF-node insertion strategy with different RBF is used in order to improve the net performances. The learning strategy is able to save computational time and memory space because of the selective growing of nodes whose activation functions consist of different RBFs. An analysis of the learning capabilities and a comparison of the net performances with other approaches have been performed. It is shown that the resulting network improves the approximation results.},

The computation results are validated against measurement data for mean surface pressure, skin friction coeﬃcients, the size and strength of the recirculating wake for the steady ﬂow regime and also for the Strouhal frequency of vortex shedding and the mean and RMS amplitude of the ﬂuctuating aerodynamic coeﬃcients for the unsteady periodic ﬂow regime.

	abstract = {The key to the better design of an industrial scale wind turbine is to understand the influence of blade geometry and its dynamics on the complicated flow-structures. An industrial-scale wind turbine can be numerically represented using various approaches (from simpler 2D steady flow to complex 3D with moving mesh, with and without the inclusion of hubs) that can alter the results substantially. At the same time, to standardize and test methodologies, the reference industrial-scale NREL 5 MW wind turbine is gaining popularity. The wind energy community will learn through an improved understanding of the aerodynamics of this NREL 5 MW reference mega-watt size wind turbine by taking into consideration the various levels of geometric approximations. Hence, in this work the NREL 5 MW reference wind turbine is used for both: (a) understanding the associated flow-complexities due to various geometric approximation, and (b) comparison and validation of the performance of different numerical approaches for flow-simulation. The various geometric approximations considered here are related to simulating the influence of the shape of turbines structure (blade, an inclusion of hub, tower) and motions of blades. It involves (a) influence of 2D, 2.5D and 3D turbine blade geometry to highlight the impact of section bluntness, (b) influence of steady frozen rotor and rotating rotor simulations and (c) influence of inclusion of hub through a full-scale geometry of the complete reference turbine. Furthermore, the key features of the flow dynamics of a rotor and full machine are identified and parametric studies are conducted to evaluate overall performance prediction under variable Tip Speed Ratios (TSR = 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9) and variable level of geometric and flow modeling approximations.},

	abstract = {There has been considerable attention given in recent years to the problem of extending finite and boundary element-based analysis of Helmholtz problems to higher frequencies. One approach is the Partition of Unity Method, which has been applied successfully to boundary integral solutions of Helmholtz problems, providing significant accuracy benefits while simultaneously reducing the required number of degrees of freedom for a given accuracy. These benefits accrue at the cost of the requirement to perform some numerically intensive calculations in order to evaluate boundary integrals of highly oscillatory functions. In this paper we adapt the numerical steepest descent method to evaluate these integrals for two-dimensional problems. The approach is successful in reducing the computational effort for most integrals encountered. The paper includes some numerical features that are important for successful practical implementation of the algorithm.},

Further studies are suggested to investigate the general validity of the initial conclusions.},

	abstract = {The ability to accurately predict vortex shedding around wind turbine blades is paramount, particularly at high Reynolds number. Turbulence models employed in the numerical studies strongly influence flow separation and the aerodynamic loading, thus affecting the overall accuracy of numerical simulations. In this manuscript, three turbulence models (Spalart–Allmaras, k−ϵ and k−ω Shear Stress Transport model) are investigated in two and three-dimensional configurations using standard Reynolds Average Navier–Stokes equations. The focus is on the NACA0015 airfoil, and the simulations are conducted at a Reynolds number of 1.96×106 to match the experimental data in the literature. The effect of flow separation and vortex shedding pattern is investigated at different angles of attack (0∘ ≤ α ≤ 17∘) along with the prediction ability of the turbulence models. Spectral analysis is performed over the time history of aerodynamic coefficients to identify the dominant frequencies along with their even and odd harmonics. A reduced-order model based on the van der Pol equation is proposed for the aerodynamic lift calculation. The method of multiple scales (a perturbation approach) is adapted to compute the coefficients of the proposed model consisting of quadratic and cubic nonlinearities at the various angle of attacks (α). The model is also tested in a predictive setting, and the results are compared against the full order model solution.},

	abstract = {The BEM is a popular technique for wave scattering problems given its inherent ability to deal with inﬁnite domains. In the last decade, the partition of unity BEM, in which the approximation space is enriched with a linear combination of plane waves, has been developed; this signiﬁcantly reduces the number of DOFs required per wavelength. It has been shown that the element ends are more susceptible to errors in the approximation than the mid-element regions. In this paper, the authors propose that this is due to the use of a collocation approach in combination with a reduced order of continuity in the Lagrangian shape function component of the basis functions. It is demonstrated, using numerical examples, that choosing trigonometric shape functions, rather than classical polynomial shape functions (quadratic in this case), provides accuracy beneﬁts. Collocation schemes are investigated; it is found that the somewhat arbitrary choice of collocating at equally spaced points about the surface of a scatterer is better than schemes based on the roots of polynomials or consideration of the Fock domain.

Specifically, we advocate the use of the recently developed Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), an equation-free method, to approximate the nonlinear term. DMD is a spatio-temporal matrix decomposition of a data matrix that correlates spatial features while simultaneously associating the activity with periodic temporal behavior. With this decomposition, one can obtain a fully reduced dimensional surrogate model and avoid the evaluation of the nonlinear term in the online stage. This allows for an impressive speed up of the computational cost, and, at the same time, accurate approximations of the problem. We present a suite of numerical tests to illustrate our approach and to show the effectiveness of the method in comparison to existing approaches.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.cpc.2019.107013},
	abstract = {The computational cost of parametric studies currently represents the major limitation to the application of simulation-based engineering techniques in a daily industrial environment. This work presents the first nonintrusive implementation of the proper generalised decomposition (PGD) in OpenFOAM, for the approximation of parametrised laminar incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The key feature of this approach is the seamless integration of a reduced order model (ROM) in the framework of an industrially validated computational fluid dynamics software. This is of special importance in an industrial environment because in the online phase of the PGD ROM the description of the flow for a specific set of parameters is obtained simply via interpolation of the generalised solution, without the need of any extra solution step. On the one hand, the spatial problems arising from the PGD separation of the unknowns are treated using the classical solution strategies of OpenFOAM, namely the semi-implicit method for pressure linked equations (SIMPLE) algorithm. On the other hand, the parametric iteration is solved via a collocation approach. The resulting ROM is applied to several benchmark tests of laminar incompressible Navier-Stokes flows, in two and three dimensions, with different parameters affecting the flow features. Eventually, the capability of the proposed strategy to treat industrial problems is verified by applying the methodology to a parametrised flow control in a realistic geometry of interest for the automotive industry.},

	abstract = {In this study, we present a nonintrusive reduced order modeling (ROM) framework for large-scale quasistationary systems. The framework proposed herein exploits the time series prediction capability of long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network architecture such that (1) in the training phase, the LSTM model is trained on the modal coefficients extracted from the high-resolution data snapshots using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) transform, and (2) in the testing phase, the trained model predicts the modal coefficients for the total time recursively based on the initial time history. Hence, no prior information about the underlying governing equations is required to generate the ROM. To illustrate the predictive performance of the proposed framework, the mean flow fields and time series response of the field values are reconstructed from the predicted modal coefficients by using an inverse POD transform. As a representative benchmark test case, we consider a two-dimensional quasigeostrophic ocean circulation model which, in general, displays an enormous range of fluctuating spatial and temporal scales. We first demonstrate that the conventional Galerkin projection-based reduced order modeling of such systems requires a high number of POD modes to obtain a stable flow physics. In addition, ROM-Galerkin projection (ROM-GP) does not seem to capture the intermittent bursts appearing in the dynamics of the first few most energetic modes. However, the proposed nonintrusive ROM framework based on LSTM (ROM-LSTM) yields a stable solution even for a small number of POD modes. We also observe that the ROM-LSTM model is able to capture quasiperiodic intermittent bursts accurately, and yields a stable and accurate mean flow dynamics using the time history of a few previous time states, denoted as the lookback time window in this paper. We show several features of ROM-LSTM framework such as significantly higher accuracy than ROM-GP, and faster performance using larger time step size. Throughout the paper, we demonstrate our findings in terms of time series evolution of the field values and mean flow patterns, which suggest that the proposed fully nonintrusive ROM framework is robust and capable of predicting chaotic nonlinear fluid flows in an extremely efficient way compared to the conventional projection-based ROM framework.},

We present a novel non-parametric background model and a background subtraction approach. The model can handle situations where the background of the scene is cluttered and not completely static but contains small motions such as tree branches and bushes. The model estimates the probability of observing pixel intensity values based on a sample of intensity values for each pixel. The model adapts quickly to changes in the scene which enables very sensitive detection of moving targets. We also show how the model can use color information to suppress detection of shadows. The implementation of the model runs in real-time for both gray level and color imagery. Evaluation shows that this approach achieves very sensitive detection with very low false alarm rates.},

In comparison to previous works, the results have been noticeably improved. The presented objective function, with its adjustable coefficients, provides more control on the cost, power, and efficiency of wind farm in comparison with earlier objective functions. Furthermore, in earlier jobs it was required to consider some subpopulations as well as individuals. However, there is no need to use the subpopulations in recent research by applying new coding approach in solving this problem. Therefore, running genetic algorithm only once for each case is sufficient. In this approach, three cases are considered (a) unidirectional uniform wind, (b) uniform wind with variable direction, and (c) non-uniform wind with variable direction. In Case (a), 10 individuals evolve over 150 generations. Case (b) has 20 individuals evolve for 150 generations. Case (c) starts with 20 individuals evolve for 100 generations. In addition to optimal configurations, results include fitness, total power output, efficiency of output power, number of turbines and objective function coefficients for each configuration.},

	abstract = {The location of wind/solar power plants is a critical part of design process. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), the well-known procedure of site selection, suffers from the local-scoring property. This paper proposes a combined approach of MCDM and artificial neural networks (ANN) to alleviate this deficiency. Here, the weighting of site selection criteria has been performed using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and then a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used for implementing the global scoring capability. By using this procedure, adding any new alternative site location cannot affect the scores of the others. In other words, the proposed procedure is global-scale and robust. Scores derived by this procedure for two candidate sites can be interpreted as real differences in these sites.},

In general, it is assumed that these methods cannot fully reproduce the real operating conditions of wind turbines. This research aims at investigating the calibration of an analytical single wake model in relation to full-scale measurements. Within this scope, we fitted the wake model to wake measurements realised with a lidar installed on the nacelle of an offshore wind turbine. We studied the parameters returned by the fit separating cases at different levels of atmospheric turbulence and thrust on the wind turbine rotor. Comparing the results with a published calibration based on few LES wind fields representative for partial load conditions, we achieved good agreement when the considered wind turbines operated in similar conditions. For other situations, i.e. at full load, we found different calibrations of the model parameters. Our results show that and how nacelle-based lidar measurements can be complementary in the development of wake models.},

Localizations of this method have reasonably low computational costs, but remain relatively inaccurate. We describe a modified Shepard's method that, without sacrificing the advantages, has accuracy comparable to other local methods. Computational efficiency is also improved by using a cell method for nearest-neighbor searching. Test results for two and three independent variables are presented.},

	abstract = {Wind energy has experienced a continuous cost reduction in the last decades. A popular cost reduction technique is to increase the rated power of the wind turbine by making it larger. However, it is not clear whether further upscaling of the existing wind turbines beyond the 5–7MW range is technically feasible and economically attractive. To address this question, this study uses 5, 10, and 20MW wind turbines that are developed using multidisciplinary design optimization as upscaling data points. These wind turbines are upwind, 3-bladed, pitch-regulated, variable-speed machines with a tubular tower. Based on the design data and properties of these wind turbines, scaling trends such as loading, mass, and cost are developed. These trends are used to study the technical and economical aspects of upscaling and its impact on the design and cost. The results of this research show the technical feasibility of the existing wind turbines up to 20MW, but the design of such an upscaled machine is cost prohibitive. Mass increase of the rotor is identified as a main design challenge to overcome. The results of this research support the development of alternative lightweight materials and design concepts such as a two-bladed downwind design for upscaling to remain a cost effective solution for future wind turbines.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate that the integration of the recently developed dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) with a multi-resolution analysis allows for a decomposition method capable of robustly separating complex systems into a hierarchy of multi-resolution time-scale components. A one-level separation allows for background (low-rank) and foreground (sparse) separation of dynamical data, or robust principal component analysis. The multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition is capable of characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in an equation-free manner by recursively decomposing the state of the system into low-rank terms whose temporal coefficients in time are known. DMD modes with temporal frequencies near the origin (zero-modes) are interpreted as background (low-rank) portions of the given dynamics, and the terms with temporal frequencies bounded away from the origin are their sparse counterparts. The multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition (mrDMD) method is demonstrated on several examples involving multi-scale dynamical data, showing excellent decomposition results, including sifting the El Ni{\textbackslash}{\textasciitilde}no mode from ocean temperature data. It is further applied to decompose a video data set into separate objects moving at different rates against a slowly varying background. These examples show that the decomposition is an effective dynamical systems tool for data-driven discovery.},

            Peña, H., and Foote, K. G. 2008. Modelling the target strength of Trachurus symmetricus murphyi based on high-resolution swimbladder morphometry using an MRI scanner. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 1751–1761. The acoustic target strength (TS) of Chilean jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus murphyi) was computed from three-dimensional reconstructions of the swimbladder form. The primary morphometric data were derived from high-resolution images made with a clinical whole-body 3-tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The fish were obtained from a commercial purse-seiner operating off Chile during 2003. Transverse MRI sequences of 18 fish were performed with a volumetric pixel 0.5 × 0.5 mm in cross section and 0.7 mm in the axial direction. From each transverse section, the swimbladder contour was traced manually using a digital pen tablet and smoothed using an automatic interpolation routine. The digital contours were used to build a triangular mesh spanning the swimbladder surface. The high-resolution swimbladder models revealed details such as undulations in the dorsal surface of the swimbladder caused by the backbone, and holes where the haemal spines penetrate the posterior end of the swimbladder. The Kirchhoff approximation was used to compute TS as a function of fish orientation at 38 kHz. The mean dorsal-aspect TS was computed for several orientation patterns and regressed on the logarithm of total fish length to derive operationally simple formulae.},

However, these characteristics make it difficult to acquire the accurate kinematics of continuum robots due to uncertainties, deformation and external loads. This paper introduces a method based on a zeroing neurodynamic approach to solve the trajectory tracking problem of continuum robots. The proposed method can achieve the control of a bellows-driven continuum robot just relying on the actuator input and sensory output information, without knowing any information of the kinematic model. This approach reduces the computational load and can guarantee the real time control. The convergence, stability, and robustness of the proposed approach are proved by theoretical analyses. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation studies including tracking performance, comparisons with other three methods, and robustness tests.},

First of all, they exhibit strong nonlinearities — which are mainly related either to nonlinear convection terms and/or some geometric variability — that often cannot be treated by simple linearization. Additional difficulties arise when attempting model reduction of unsteady flows, especially when long-term transient behavior needs to be accurately predicted using reduced order models and more complex features, such as turbulence or multiphysics phenomena, have to be taken into consideration. We first discuss some general principles that apply to many parametric model order reduction problems, then we apply them on steady and unsteady viscous flows modelled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We address questions of inf-sup stability, certification through error estimation, computational issues and — in the unsteady case — long-time stability of the reduced model. Moreover, we provide an extensive list of literature references.},

	abstract = {Rapporten inneholder beskrivelse av metoder for lokal data-assimilering relatert til varsling av turbulens ved flyplasser. Den inneholder beskrivelse av en metode for data-assimilering og testing av denne på en enkel geometri som representerer en symmetrisk fjelltopp (”Hunt-fjellet”). En relativt grovmasket grid-oppløsning er valgt, men god nok til å representere hovedstrukturen i strømningen. Alle beregningene er gjennomført for nøytral strømning, d.v.s. uten stratifikasjon. 
Det spesielle med lokal data-assimilering er at området er relativt lite, slik at transporttiden gjennom området blir kort ved sterk vind. Dette gjør at randbetingelser blir viktigere enn initialbetingelser, og konvensjonelle assimilasjons-metoder er derfor mindre egnet. Et karaktertrekk ved lokal data-assimilering er relativt få datapunkter i de fleste tilfeller. Med bakgrunn i denne typen vurderinger har vi valgt å teste en formulering basert på forenklet 3d-Var, og gjennomført noen elementære numeriske testsimuleringer. En konklusjon fra denne analyse er at ”korreksjon av randbetingelser i prediksjonsintervallet” er et hovedproblem for en effektiv bruk av lokal data-assimilering.  
På bakgrunn av konklusjonen ovenfor og i tråd med ideen fra 4d-Var benytter vi derfor et tidsvindu for å analysere trenden i avvik mellom data og tidligere prediksjon. Dette kan så benyttes i den videre korreksjon av randbetingelsene i prediksjonsperioden. Rapporten inneholder beskrivelse av en type tidsvariasjonsmetode og en analyse av denne, samt testing av metoden på noen stiliserte eksempler. Dette arbeidet vil bli videreført og tenkes generalisert for utprøving i mer realistiske situasjoner.},

Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.},

	abstract = {Rapid advances in 2D perception have led to systems that accurately detect objects in real-world images. However, these systems make predictions in 2D, ignoring the 3D structure of the world. Concurrently, advances in 3D shape prediction have mostly focused on synthetic benchmarks and isolated objects. We unify advances in these two areas. We propose a system that detects objects in real-world images and produces a triangle mesh giving the full 3D shape of each detected object. Our system, called Mesh R-CNN, augments Mask R-CNN with a mesh prediction branch that outputs meshes with varying topological structure by first predicting coarse voxel representations which are converted to meshes and refined with a graph convolution network operating over the mesh's vertices and edges. We validate our mesh prediction branch on ShapeNet, where we outperform prior work on single-image shape prediction. We then deploy our full Mesh R-CNN system on Pix3D, where we jointly detect objects and predict their 3D shapes.},

	abstract = {The problem of error estimation in the numerical solution of integral equations that arise in electromagnetics is addressed. The direct method (Green’s theorem or ﬁeld approach) and the indirect method (layer ansatz or source approach) lead to well-known integral equations both of the ﬁrst kind [electric ﬁeld integral equations (EFIE)] and the second kind [magnetic ﬁeld integral equations (MFIE)]. These equations are analyzed systematically in terms of the mapping properties of the integral operators. It is shown how the assumption that ﬁeld quantities have ﬁnite energy leads naturally to describing the mapping properties in appropriate Sobolev spaces. These function spaces are demystiﬁed through simple examples which also are used to demonstrate the importance of knowing in which space the given data lives and in which space the solution should be sought. It is further shown how the method of moments (or Galerkin method) is formulated in these function spaces and how residual error can be used to estimate actual error in these spaces. The condition number of all of the impedance matrices that result from discretizing the integral equations, including ﬁrst kind equations, is shown to be bounded when the elements are computed appropriately. Finally, the consequences of carrying out all computations in the space of square integrable functions, a particularly friendly Sobolev space, are explained.},

We analyse variational techniques for the numerical resolution of PDEs based on splines or NURBS and we provide optimal approximation and error estimates in several cases of interest. The theory presented also includes estimates for T-splines, which are an extension of splines allowing for local refinement. In particular, we focus our attention on elliptic and saddle point problems, and we define spline edge and face elements. Our theoretical results are demonstrated by a rich set of numerical examples. Finally, we discuss implementation and efficiency together with preconditioning issues for the final linear system.},

	abstract = {We present a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework for object instance segmentation. Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition.

	abstract = {Dynamically impacting systems are characterised with inherent instability and complex non-linear phenomena which makes it practically difficult to predict the steady state response of the system at transient periods. This study investigates the ability of a data driven machine learning method using Long Short-Term Memory networks to learn the complex nonlinearity associated with co-existing impact responses from limited transient data. A one-degree-of-freedom impact oscillator has been used to represent the bit–rock interaction for percussive drilling. Simulated data results show velocity measurements to contribute most to predicting steady state responses from transient dynamics with most of the network models reaching an accuracy of over 95\%. Limitations to practically measurable variables in dynamic systems warranted the development of a feature based network model for impact motion classification. Experimental data from a two-degrees-of-freedom impacting system representing percussive bit penetration has been used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. The study thus provides a precise and less computational means of detecting and avoiding underperforming impact modes in percussive drilling.},

	abstract = {I denne rapporten er det gjennomført systematiske korreksjoner av SIMRA-prediksjoner ved bruk av flydata. Disse korreksjonene er gjort på grunnlag av sammenligninger mellom ukorrigerte simuleringer og flydata i øvre del av SIMRA-området, hvor både vindstyrke og retning gis en konstant korreksjon. 
 
Analyser av tilgjengelige flydata for Værnes-området viser at det idag finnes relativt få data-registreringer, maksimalt 2 - 3 fly pr dag med et typisk mellomrom på 3 - 5 timer. Med så spredte data tilgjengelig er det foreløpig langt igjen før slike korreksjoner kan benyttes i varsling, men det er likevel verdt å undersøke alternative metodikker med tanke på framtidig bruk.

For å utnytte alle tilgjengelige flydata, dvs. data-registreringer langs hele flybanen i SIMRA-området, er det nødvendig å generalisere metodikken slik at terreng-effekten kan tas hensyn til. Bruk av sensitivitetsfelt er en mulig metodikk for å gjøre nettopp dette. En  slik metode er testet i denne rapporten for et forenklet 2D tilfelle, og den naturlige  fortsettelsen vil være å gjennomføre tilsvarende testing med 3D topografi. En slik  generalisering planlegges i videreføringen av dette prosjektet.

This 25 turbine wind farm is located in a highly complex terrain and is exposed to predominantly high westerly and south easterly winds. A one-equation sub-grid scale LES turbulence model has been used to help capture the wake dynamics: particularly the effects of wake meandering and wake-turbine interactions. A comparison between RANS and LES models highlights the influence of turbulence model on wake decay and its subsequent effect on prediction of power production. The LES model predicts delayed decay of the wake and more pronounced wake interference leading to a lower power production in wind farm than the RANS case. The RANS model overpredicts turbulence, which cause faster turbulent momentum diffusivity and faster wake recovery. This study has given some insights regarding the power production at Bessaker wind farm for neutral conditions and westerly flow.},

	abstract = {Digital twin, a concept introduced in 2002, is becoming increasingly relevant to systems engineering and, more specifically, to model-based system engineering (MBSE). A digital twin, like a virtual prototype, is a dynamic digital representation of a physical system. However, unlike a virtual prototype, a digital twin is a virtual instance of a physical system (twin) that is continually updated with the latter\&rsquo;s performance, maintenance, and health status data throughout the physical system\&rsquo;s life cycle. This paper presents an overall vision and rationale for incorporating digital twin technology into MBSE. The paper discusses the benefits of integrating digital twins with system simulation and Internet of Things (IoT) in support of MBSE and provides specific examples of the use and benefits of digital twin technology in different industries. It concludes with a recommendation to make digital twin technology an integral part of MBSE methodology and experimentation testbeds.},

	abstract = {In the field of computational electrodynamics the discretization of Maxwell`s equations using the Finite Integration Theory (FIT) yields very large, sparse, complex symmetric linear systems of equations. For this class of complex non-Hermitian systems a number of conjugate gradient-type algorithms is considered. The complex version of the biconjugate gradient (BiCG) method by Jacobs can be extended to a whole class of methods for complex-symmetric algorithms SCBiCG(T, n), which only require one matrix vector multiplication per iteration step. In this class the well-known conjugate orthogonal conjugate gradient (COCG) method for complex-symmetric systems corresponds to the case n = 0. The case n = 1 yields the BiCGCR method which corresponds to the conjugate residual algorithm for the real-valued case. These methods in combination with a minimal residual smoothing process are applied separately to practical 3D electro-quasistatical and eddy-current problems in electrodynamics. The practical performance of the SCBiCG methods is compared with other methods such as QMR and TFQMR.},

	abstract = {In order to remain competitive, wind turbines must be reliable machines with efficient and effective maintenance strategies. However, thus far, wind turbine reliability information has been closely guarded by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and turbine reliability studies often rely on data that are not always in a usable or consistent format. In addition, issues with turbine maintenance logs and alarm system data can make it hard to identify historical periods of faulty operation. This means that building new and effective data-driven condition monitoring techniques and methods can be challenging, especially those that rely on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system data. Such data are rarely standardised, resulting in challenges for researchers in contextualising these data. This work aims to summarise some of the issues seen in previous studies, highlighting the common problems seen by researchers working in the areas of condition monitoring and reliability analysis. Standards and policy initiatives that aim to alleviate some of these problems are given, and a summary of their recommendations is presented. The main finding from this work is that industry would benefit hugely from unified standards for turbine taxonomies, alarm codes, SCADA operational data and maintenance and fault reporting.},

This has proven to be difficult using traditional isogeometric methods, as the tensor-product nature of trivariate NURBS and T-splines limit their ability to provide analysis suitable parameterizations of arbitrarily complex volumes. To overcome the limitations of trivariate NURBS and T-splines, we propose the use of unstructured Bernstein–Bézier discretizations. In earlier work, we demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in two dimensions through the construction of an automatic mesh generation environment capable of generating geometrically exact unstructured meshes comprised of rational Bézier triangles. This paper extends the concepts presented in our previous work to unstructured tetrahedral and mixed-element meshes in three dimensions. The main contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, we present a framework for creating geometrically exact meshes comprised of rational Bézier hexahedra, tetrahedra, wedges and pyramids through degree elevation of suitable linear meshes. We additionally discuss how our approach may be applied to higherorder mesh generation for more traditional finite element approaches. Next, we propose two quality metrics for three-dimensional curvilinear meshes, and discuss some important considerations for mesh quality of higher-order meshes. Finally, we demonstrate the analysis suitability of the meshes constructed using our framework through numerical examples.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an isogeometric formulation of the perfectly matched layer (PML) for time-harmonic acoustic simulations. The new formulation is a generalization of the conventional locally-conformal PML, in which the NURBS patch supporting the PML domain is transformed from real space to complex space. This is achieved by complex coordinate stretching, based on a stretching vector field indicating the directions in which incident sound waves are absorbed. To solve the difficulty that stretching vectors cannot be defined for control points not lying on the patch, an interpolation method is proposed in which the control-point stretching vectors are calculated by interpolating those at a set of integration points. An automatically matched layer (AML) is also formulated in the isogeometric context. Due to its form-invariant nature, the Helmholtz equation which governs time-harmonic acoustics is kept unchanged in the complex space, except that the Laplacian operator and the sound pressure should be transformed to their complex forms. The performance of the isogeometric PML formulation is discussed through several numerical examples, spanning one to three dimensions and involving both sound radiation and sound scattering problems. It is found that the proposed method presents superior computational accuracy, high geometric adaptivity, and good robustness against challenging geometric features. The geometry-preserving ability inherent in the isogeometric framework brings extra benefits by eliminating geometric errors that are unavoidable in the conventional PML. Meanwhile, these properties are not sensitive to the location of the sound source or the depth of the PML domain. The implementation of the isogeometric PML only requires the replacement of real control-point coordinates by complex ones, making it possible to incorporate the proposed method to various existing numerical routines.},

	abstract = {This paper provides an Isogeometric Indirect Boundary Element Method (IGIBEM) based on NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) and PHT-splines (polynomial splines over hierarchical T-meshes) for analyzing the three-dimensional (3D) acoustic problems. In the classical procedure, the geometries are discretized by Lagrange polynomials elements, which leads to both substantial geometrical error and time-consuming meshing steps. However, these deficiencies can be eliminated by the isogeometric analysis (IGA) directly incorporating the geometry description generated from the CAD (Computer Aided Design) software into CAE (Computer Aided Engineering) analysis. Unlike the DBEM (direct boundary element method), the IBEM (indirect boundary element method) allows different types of boundary conditions on the two sides of a surface. Moreover, the hypersingular integrals in IBEM can be transformed to a weakly singular form. In addition, the PHT-based IBEM is used to investigate the influence of local refinement on the accuracy of solutions. Finally, the non-uniqueness problem is solved, which is a fatal defect in the acoustic BEM for the exterior problem. Four different methods to handle the non-uniqueness problem are discussed and compared. The results obtained by the proposed method were compared with analytical solutions and the results computed by Lagrange-based IBEM. Several benchmark examples demonstrate: (1) the present method, i.e. IGIBEM, has super accuracy over conventional IBEM for the acoustic problems; (2) local refinement has a significant influence on the convergence rate of the solutions, and the numerical accuracy is relevant to the distance to the boundary where the local refinement acted; (3) as for the non-uniqueness problem, the imposition of specific interior boundary conditions not only obtains the best calculation result over the entire range of frequencies, but also has a simple integral formulation.},

We take the augmented Lagrangian approach to FSI as a point of departure. Here the Lagrange multiplier ﬁeld is deﬁned on the ﬂuid–structure interface and is responsible for coupling of the two subsystems. Thus the FSI formulation does not rely on the continuity of the underlying function spaces across the ﬂuid–structure interface in order to produce the correct coupling conditions between the ﬂuid and structural subdomains. However, in deriving the ﬁnal FSI formulation the interface Lagrange multiplier is formally eliminated and the formulation is written purely in terms of primal variables. Avoiding the use of Lagrange multipliers adds efﬁciency to the proposed formulation. As an added beneﬁt, the ability to employ non-matching grids for multi-physics simulations leads to signiﬁcantly relaxed requirements that are placed on the geometry modeling and meshing tools for IGA.},

A triangular Loop subdivision surface discretisation is used for both geometry and analysis fields. The Kirchhoff-Love shell equation is discretised with the finite element method and the Helmholtz equation for the acoustic field with the boundary element method. The use of the boundary element formulation allows the elegant handling of infinite domains and precludes the need for volumetric meshing. In the present work, the subdivision control meshes for the shell displacements and the acoustic pressures have the same resolution. The corresponding smooth subdivision basis functions have the C1 continuity property required for the Kirchhoff-Love formulation and are highly efficient for the acoustic field computations. We verify the proposed isogeometric formulation through a closed-form solution of acoustic scattering over a thin-shell sphere. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to handle complex geometries with arbitrary topology that provides an integrated isogeometric design and analysis workflow for coupled structural-acoustic analysis of shells.},

Analogues of ﬁnite element h- and p-reﬁnement schemes are presented and a new, more eﬃcient, higher-order concept, k-reﬁnement, is introduced. Reﬁnements are easily implemented and exact geometry is maintained at all levels without the necessity of subsequent communication with a CAD (Computer Aided Design) description. In the context of structural mechanics, it is established that the basis functions are complete with respect to aﬃne transformations, meaning that all rigid body motions and constant strain states are exactly represented. Standard patch tests are likewise satisﬁed. Numerical examples exhibit optimal rates of convergence for linear elasticity problems and convergence to thin elastic shell solutions. A k-reﬁnement strategy is shown to converge toward monotone solutions for advection–diﬀusion processes with sharp internal and boundary layers, a very surprising result. It is argued that isogeometric analysis is a viable alternative to standard, polynomial-based, ﬁnite element analysis and possesses several advantages.},

Given a NURBS represented geometry, either untrimmed or trimmed, we first convert it to a watertight geometry represented by rational triangular Be´zier splines (rTBS). For trimmed geometries, a compatible subdivision scheme is developed to guarantee the watertightness. The rTBS geometry preserves exactly the original NURBS surfaces except for an interface layer between trimmed surfaces where controlled approximation occurs. From the watertight rTBS geometry, a Be´zier tetrahedral partition is generated automatically. By imposing continuity constraints on Be´zier ordinates of the elements, we obtain a set of global Cr smooth basis functions and use it as the basis for analysis. Numerical examples demonstrate that our method achieves optimal convergence in Cr spaces and can handle complicated geometries.},

The implications to practical engineering design scenarios are profound, since the time taken from design to analysis is greatly reduced, leading to dramatic gains in efficiency. In this manuscript, through a self-contained Matlab⃝R implementation, we present an introduction to IGA applied to simple analysis problems and the related computer implementation aspects. Furthermore, implementation of the extended IGA which incorporates enrichment functions through the partition of unity method (PUM) is also presented, where several examples for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional fracture are illustrated. We also describe the use of IGA in the context of strong-form (collocation) formulations, which has been an area of research interest due to the potential for significant efficiency gains offered by these methods. The code which accompanies the present paper can be applied to one, two and three-dimensional problems for linear elasticity, linear elastic fracture mechanics, structural mechanics (beams/plates/shells including large displacements and rotations) and Poisson problems with or without enrichment. The Be´zier extraction concept that allows the FE analysis to be performed efficiently on T-spline geometries is also incorporated.

Isogeometric Analysis is a generalization of classical Finite Element Analysis (FEA) which possesses improved properties. For example, NURBS are capable of more precise geometric representation of complex objects and, in particular, can exactly represent many commonly engineered shapes, such as cylinders, spheres and tori. Isogeometric Analysis also simpliﬁes mesh reﬁnement because the geometry is ﬁxed at the coarsest level of reﬁnement and is unchanged throughout the reﬁnement process. This eliminates geometrical errors and the necessity of linking the reﬁnement procedure to a CAD representation of the geometry, as in classical FEA. In this work we study approximation and stability properties in the context of h-reﬁnement. We develop approximation estimates based on a new BrambleHilbert lemma in so-called “bent” Sobolev spaces appropriate for NURBS approximations and we establish inverse estimates similar to ones for ﬁnite elements. We apply the theoretical results to several cases of interest including elasticity, isotropic incompressible elasticity and Stokes ﬂow, and advection-diﬀusion, and perform numerical tests which corroborate the mathematical results. We also perform numerical calculations that involve hypotheses outside our theory and these suggest that there are many other interesting mathematical properties of Isogeometric Analysis yet to be proved.},

	abstract = {We consider Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) for the numerical solution of the electrophysiology of the atria, which in this work is modeled by means of the bidomain equations on thin surfaces. First, we consider the bidomain equations coupled with the Roger–McCulloch ionic model on simple slabs. Here, our goal is to evaluate the effects of the spatial discretization by IGA and the use of different B-spline basis functions on the accuracy of the approximation, in particular regarding the accuracy of the front velocity and the dispersion error. Specifically, we consider basis functions with high polynomial degree, p, and global high order continuity, C p−1, in the computational domain: our results show that the use of such basis functions is beneficial to the accurate approximation of the solution. Then, we consider a realistic application of the bidomain equations coupled with the Courtemanche–Ramirez–Nattel ionic model on the two human atria, which are represented by means of two NURBS surfaces.},

	abstract = {The Cahn–Hilliard equation involves fourth-order spatial derivatives. Finite element solutions are not common because primal variational formulations of fourth-order operators are only well deﬁned and integrable if the ﬁnite element basis functions are piecewise smooth and globally C1-continuous. There are a very limited number of two-dimensional ﬁnite elements possessing C1-continuity applicable to complex geometries, but none in three-dimensions. We propose isogeometric analysis as a technology that possesses a unique combination of attributes for complex problems involving higher-order differential operators, namely, higher-order accuracy, robustness, two- and three-dimensional geometric ﬂexibility, compact support, and, most importantly, the possibility of C1 and higher-order continuity. A NURBS-based variational formulation for the Cahn–Hilliard equation was tested on two- and three-dimensional problems. We present steady state solutions in two-dimensions and, for the ﬁrst time, in three-dimensions. To achieve these results an adaptive time-stepping method is introduced. We also present a technique for desensitizing calculations to dependence on mesh reﬁnement. This enables the calculation of topologically correct solutions on coarse meshes, opening the way to practical engineering applications of phase-ﬁeld methodology.},

	abstract = {We consider the propagation of sound through a slowly moving fluid in a 2-dimensional duct. A detailed description of a flow-acoustic model of the problem using B-spline based isogeometric analysis is given. The model couples the non-linear, steady-state, incompressible Navier–Stokes equation in the laminar regime for the flow field, to a linear, time-harmonic acoustic equation in the low Mach number regime for the sound signal. B-splines are used both to represent the duct geometry and to approximate the flow and sound fields. This facilitates an exact representation of complex duct geometries, as well as high continuity approximations of state variables. Acoustic boundary conditions on artificial truncation boundaries are treated using a mode matching formulation. We validate the model against known acoustic modes for a uniform flow through a straight duct. Improved error convergence rates are found when the acoustic pressure is approximated by higher order polynomials. Based on the model, we examine how the acoustic signal varies with sound frequency, flow speed and duct geometry. A combination of duct geometry and sound frequency is identified for which the acoustic signal is particularly sensitive to the flow speed.},

The geometrical spirit embodied in Argyris’s work is revived in the sequel in applying the newly developed concept of isogeometric analysis to structural vibration problems. After reviewing some fundamentals of isogeometric analysis, application is made to several structural models, including rods, thin beams, membranes, and thin plates. Rotationless beam and plate models are utilized as well as three-dimensional solid models. The concept of k-reﬁnement is explored and shown to produce more accurate and robust results than corresponding ﬁnite elements. Through the use of nonlinear parameterization, ‘‘optical’’ branches of frequency spectra are eliminated for k-reﬁned meshes. Optical branches have been identiﬁed as contributors to Gibbs phenomena in wave propagation problems and the cause of rapid degradation of higher modes in p-method ﬁnite elements. A geometrically exact model of the NASA Aluminum Testbed Cylinder is constructed and frequencies and mode shapes are computed and shown to compare favorably with experimental results.},

The performance of the mixed forms is assessed by studying two numerical examples involving large-deformation nearly incompressible elasticity and elastoplasticity.

The method is based on the variational framework that is suitable for discretization by standard ﬁnite elements as well as the basis functions employed in isogeometric analysis. The underlying numerical formulation globally conserves mass and preserves a sharp air–water interface for the entire length of the simulation. The numerical tests indicate that the proposed methodology gives an accurate description of the free-surface behavior in both quasi-steady and dynamic regimes. Furthermore, very good per-degree-of-freedom accuracy is obtained when higher-order and higher-continuity isogeometric discretizations are employed in free-surface computations. Ó 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, the performance of IGA coupled with the infinite element method (IEM) for some acoustic scattering problems is investigated. In particular, the simple problem of acoustic scattering by a rigid sphere, and the scattering of acoustic waves by an elastic spherical shell with fluid domains both inside and outside, representing a full acoustic-structure interaction (ASI) problem. Finally, a mock shell and a simplified submarine benchmark are investigated. The numerical examples include comparisons between IGA and the FEM. Our main finding is that the usage of IGA significantly increases the accuracy compared to the usage of C0 FEM due to increased inter-element continuity of the spline basis functions.},

However, its simplicity can be advanced further using the isogeometric framework. This work presents a spline based PML formulation which avoids additional coordinate transformation as the formulation is based on the same space in which the numerical solution is sought. The procedure can be automated for any convex artificial boundary. This removes restrictions on the domain construction using PML and can therefore reduce computational cost and improve mesh quality. The usage of spline basis functions with higher continuity also improves the accuracy of the PML-approximation and the numerical solution.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the ﬁctitious eigenfrequency problem of the boundary integral equation methods when solving exterior acoustic problems. A contour integral method is used to convert the nonlinear eigenproblems caused by the boundary element method into ordinary eigenproblems. Since both real and complex eigenvalues can be extracted by using the contour integral method, it enables us to investigate the ﬁctitious eigenfrequency problem in a new way rather than comparing the accuracy of numerical solutions or the condition numbers of boundary element coefﬁcient matrices. The interior and exterior acoustic ﬁelds of a sphere with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are taken as numerical examples. The pulsating sphere example is studied and all ﬁctitious eigenfrequencies corresponding to the related interior problem are observed. The reasons are given for the usual absence of many ﬁctitious eigenfrequencies in the literature. Fictitious eigenfrequency phenomena of the Kirchhoff–Helmholtz boundary integral equation, its normal derivative formulation and the Burton–Miller formulation are investigated through the eigenvalue analysis. The actual effect of the Burton–Miller formulation on ﬁctitious eigenfrequencies is revealed and the optimal choice of the coupling parameter is conﬁrmed.},

	abstract = {The intensity of a tropical cyclone is correlated strongly to the damage it causes when it makes landfall. Most of the time, tropical cyclones are located over the open ocean, where direct intensity measurements are difficult to obtain. An alternative approach is to estimate the tropical cyclone intensity indirectly from satellite images. In this case, there are two key points to consider: spatial and temporal relationships. For spatial relationships, the basic assumption is that cyclones with similar intensities have similar patterns. Thus, researchers can estimate intensity using pattern extraction and investigating similarities. For temporal relationships, the intensity of the cyclone is assumed to change smoothly, as a tropical cyclone is a continuous weather phenomenon. Thus, satellite images belonging to the same tropical cyclone should have a temporal (chronological) relationship with one another, meaning that the estimated intensity value of subsequent images should not change too drastically. In this research, we take advantage of these two key points and use random walk with a restart model to discover hidden correlations between target and historical cyclone images to estimate their intensity. We then use machine learning models to determine the temporal relationships among cyclone images, smoothing the prediction of the tropical cyclone event as a whole. Finally, our results show 15.77-knot root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the intensity estimation of tropical cyclones in the West Pacific Basin area.},

To address such challenges, we introduce an interface learning paradigm and put forth a data-driven closure approach based on memory embedding to provide physically correct boundary conditions at the interface. To enable the interface learning for hyperbolic systems by considering the domain of influence and wave structures into account, we put forth the concept of upwind learning toward a physics-informed domain decomposition. The promise of the proposed approach is shown for a set of canonical illustrative problems. We highlight that high-performance computing environments can benefit from this methodology to reduce communication costs among processing units in emerging machine-learning-ready heterogeneous platforms toward exascale era.},

	abstract = {Isogeometric analysis (IGA) has been developed for more than a decade. However, the usage of IGA is by far limited mostly within academic community. The lack of automatic or semi-automatic software platform of IGA is one of the main bottlenecks that prevent IGA from wide applications in industry. In this paper, we present a comprehensive IGA software platform that allows IGA to be incorporated into existing commercial software such as Abaqus, heading one step further to bridge the gap between design and analysis. The proposed IGA software framework takes advantage of user-defined elements in Abaqus, linking with general. IGES files from commercial computer aided design packages, Rhino specific files and mesh data. The platform includes all the necessary modules of the design-through-analysis pipeline: pre-processing, surface and volumetric T-spline construction, analysis and post-processing. Several practical application problems are studied to demonstrate the capability of the proposed software platform.},

	abstract = {Inÿnite element schemes for unbounded wave problems are reviewed and a procedure is presented for assessing their performance. A general computational scheme is implemented in which orthogonal functions are used for the transverse interpolation within the inÿnite element region. This is used as a basis for numerical studies of the e ectiveness of various combinations of the radial test and trial functions which give rise to di erent conjugated and unconjugated formulations. Results are presented for the test case of a spherical radiator to which inÿnite elements are directly attached. Accuracy of the various schemes is assessed for pure multipole solutions of arbitrary order. Previous studies which have indicated that the conjugated and unconjugated schemes are more e ective in the far and near ÿelds, respectively, are conÿrmed by the current results. All of the schemes tested converge to the exact solution as radial order increases. All are however susceptible to ill conditioning. This places practical restrictions on their e ectiveness at high radial orders. A close relationship is demonstrated between the discrete equations which arise from ÿrst-order inÿnite element schemes and those derived from the application of more traditional, local non-re ecting boundary conditions.

	abstract = {Very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question of whether there are any benefit in combining the Inception architecture with residual connections. Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4, we achieve 3.08 percent top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge},

These elements extend to inÿnity in one dimension and therefore provide an approach to the simulation of exterior acoustical problems in both frequency and time domains. Their formulation is improved signiÿcantly through the proper choice of polynomial bases in the direction of radiation. In particular, certain Jacobi polynomials are identiÿed which behave well with respect to conditioning of the system matrices. As a consequence, the size of the ÿnite element discretization may reduce considerably without any loss of accuracy. In addition, the new polynomial bases lead to superior performance of the inÿnite elements in conjunction with iterative solvers. Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The present paper removes this limitation. Two alternative formulations are studied. In the first one any curvilinear geometry is represented accurately but the rigid body modes are recovered only in the limit as the p-refinement level is increased. In contrast, the second formulation represents the rigid modes exactly while the actual curvilinear geometry is approached with increasing accuracy as the p-refinement level is increased. The practical efficiency of the two alternative approaches is studied and assessed on pertinent examples of thin plates in bending.},

Applications to several benchmark problems in plate bending are presented. Sample results are examined and compared both with theoretical predictions and with the computations of other programs. Significant improvements are shown for the results obtained using CONE.},

The proposed method uses a high-order hybridisable discontinuous Galerkin formulation and the proper generalised decomposition rationale to construct an off-line solution for a given set of geometric parameters. The generalised solution contains the information for all the geometric parameters in a user-defined range and it can be used to compute sensitivities. The proposed approach circumvents many of the weaknesses of other approaches based on the proper generalised decomposition for computing generalised solutions of geometrically parametrised problems. Four numerical examples show the optimal mesh convergence properties of the proposed method and demonstrate its applicability in two and three dimensions, with particular emphasis on parametrised flows in microfluidics.},

To leverage these developments, our aim in this perspective paper is centered around exploring numerous principle concepts to address the challenges of (i) trustworthiness and generalizability in developing data-driven models to shed light on understanding the fundamental trade-offs in their accuracy and efficiency and (ii) seamless integration of interface learning and multifidelity coupling approaches that transfer and represent information between different entities, particularly when different scales are governed by different physics, each operating on a different level of abstraction. Addressing these challenges could enable the revolution of digital twin technologies for scientific and engineering applications.},

	abstract = {This work is concerned with a unique combination of high order local absorbing boundary conditions (ABC) with a general curvilinear Finite Element Method (FEM) and its implementation in Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) for time-harmonic acoustic waves. The ABC employed were recently devised by Villamizar et al. (2017) . They are derived from exact Farfield Expansions representations of the outgoing waves in the exterior of the regions enclosed by the artificial boundary. As a consequence, the error due to the ABC on the artificial boundary can be reduced conveniently such that the dominant error comes from the volume discretization method used in the interior of the computational domain. Reciprocally, the error in the interior can be made as small as the error at the artificial boundary by appropriate implementation of p- and h-refinement. We apply this novel method to cylindrical, spherical and arbitrary shape scatterers including a prototype submarine. Our numerical results exhibit spectral-like approximation and high order convergence rate. Additionally, they show that the proposed method can reduce both the pollution and artificial boundary errors to negligible levels even in very low- and high-frequency regimes with rather coarse discretization densities in the IGA. As a result, we have developed a highly accurate computational platform to numerically solve time-harmonic acoustic wave scattering in two- and three-dimensions.},

	abstract = {The paper first treats the locking problem of shear-elastic plates in bending in the context of multi-grid-methods. A new plate bending element with shape functions of the Allman-type is presented and used for linear and non-linear problems. An important issue is the presentation of a flexible mesh generator with different refinement strategies according to a priori criteria. Different a posteriori criteria for adaptive approximations are given, such as a gradient-based error with one and two indicators for geometrically non-linear load paths, the first being residuum based and the second controlling the geometrical nonlinearities. Branch switching and post-buckling deformation processes are investigated adaptively using these indicators and demonstrated with examples. Another important topic is the automatic dimensional adaptivity of beams and plates within disturbed zones as boundary layers, concentrated load areas and sharp changes of thicknesses This d-adaptivity is combined with h-adaptivity and illustrated by some examples.},

Solutions of the Helmholtz equation have two features: global oscillations associated with the wave number and local gradients caused by geometrical irregularities. We show that after a sufficient number of degrees of freedom is used to approximate global oscillations, adaptive refinement can capture local features of the solution. We compare residual-based and recovery-based error estimators and investigate the performance of p-refinement. The simulations are done in the context of recently introduced Geometry Independent Field approximaTion (GIFT), where PHTsplines are only used to approximate the solution, while the computational domain is parameterized with NURBS. This approach builds on the natural adaptation ability of PHTsplines and avoids the re-parameterization of the NURBS geometry during the solution refinement process.},

Hence, accurate values for these local quantities is essentially what one wants to get out of the ﬂow computations. By means of variationally consistent postprocessing, where forces are computed using the weak form of the equations, we recover the requested forces. Goal oriented local error indicators are provided by solving an auxiliary problem. At the end numerical examples are presented that illustrate how this goal oriented strategy gives improved eﬃciency compared to traditional methods. The ﬂuid ﬂow is assumed to be governed by the Stokes equations.},

	abstract = {Digital twins are meant to bridge the gap between real-world physical systems and virtual representations. Both stand-alone and descriptive digital twins incorporate 3D geometric models, which are the physical representations of objects in the digital replica. Digital twin applications are required to rapidly update internal parameters with the evolution of their physical counterpart. Due to an essential need for having high-quality geometric models for accurate physical representations, the storage and bandwidth requirements for storing 3D model information can quickly exceed the available storage and bandwidth capacity. In this work, we demonstrate a novel approach to geometric change detection in a digital twin context. We address the issue through a combined solution of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) for motion detection, YOLOv5 for object detection, and 3D machine learning for pose estimation. DMD is applied for background subtraction, enabling detection of moving foreground objects in real-time. The video frames containing detected motion are extracted and used as input to the change detection network. The object detection algorithm YOLOv5 is applied to extract the bounding boxes of detected objects in the video frames. Furthermore, we estimate the rotational pose of each object in a 3D pose estimation network. A series of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) conducts feature extraction from images and 3D model shapes. Then, the network outputs the camera orientation’s estimated Euler angles concerning the object in the input image. By only storing data associated with a detected change in pose, we minimize necessary storage and bandwidth requirements while still recreating the 3D scene on demand. Our assessment of the new geometric detection framework shows that the proposed methodology could represent a viable tool in emerging digital twin applications.},

This work is now extended with a scaling strategy significantly mitigating the problem of overflow and thus expanding the useful frequency range of the model. Moreover, new boundary conditions and loads are implemented. Most important are the fluid–fluid and solid–solid couplings, which allow a completely general layering of the scattering object. Sound hard and sound soft boundary conditions are implemented for solids and fluids respectively. In addition to the existing acoustic excitation, mechanical excitation in the form of point-excitation and surface excitation are implemented. Attenuation in the form of hysteresis damping as well as viscous fluid layers are also included. Several numerical examples are included, with the purpose of validating the code against existing reference solutions. The examples include air bubbles, a coated steel shell and a point-exited steel shell.},

	abstract = {A new edition of a graduate-level machine learning textbook that focuses on the analysis and theory of algorithms.This book is a general introduction to machine learning that can serve as a textbook for graduate students and a reference for researchers. It covers fundamental modern topics in machine learning while providing the theoretical basis and conceptual tools needed for the discussion and justification of algorithms. It also describes several key aspects of the application of these algorithms. The authors aim to present novel theoretical tools and concepts while giving concise proofs even for relatively advanced topics. Foundations of Machine Learning is unique in its focus on the analysis and theory of algorithms. The first four chapters lay the theoretical foundation for what follows; subsequent chapters are mostly self-contained. Topics covered include the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework; generalization bounds based on Rademacher complexity and VC-dimension; Support Vector Machines (SVMs); kernel methods; boosting; on-line learning; multi-class classification; ranking; regression; algorithmic stability; dimensionality reduction; learning automata and languages; and reinforcement learning. Each chapter ends with a set of exercises. Appendixes provide additional material including concise probability review.This second edition offers three new chapters, on model selection, maximum entropy models, and conditional entropy models. New material in the appendixes includes a major section on Fenchel duality, expanded coverage of concentration inequalities, and an entirely new entry on information theory. More than half of the exercises are new to this edition.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a variational approach to estimate eddy viscosity using forward sensitivity method (FSM) for closure modeling in nonlinear reduced order models. FSM is a data assimilation technique that blends model's predictions with noisy observations to correct initial state and/or model parameters. We apply this approach on a projection based reduced order model (ROM) of the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation with a square wave defining a moving shock, and the two-dimensional vorticity transport equation formulating a decay of Kraichnan turbulence. We investigate the capability of the approach to approximate an optimal value for eddy viscosity with different measurement configurations. Specifically, we show that our approach can sufficiently assimilate information either through full-field or sparse noisy measurements to estimate eddy viscosity closure to cure standard Galerkin reduced order model (GROM) predictions. Therefore, our approach provides a modular framework to correct forecasting error from a sparse observational network on a latent space. We highlight that the proposed GROM-FSM framework is promising for emerging digital twin applications, where real-time sensor measurements can be used to update and optimize surrogate model's parameters.},

	abstract = {Forecast models for wind speed and wind turbine power generation are valuable support tools for operators of Control Energy Center. In this work, a year of daily energy output of a wind turbine is analyzed. The original time series was separated into a high-power sample and a low-power sample. High-power sample has a seasonal pattern while low-power sample does not. Afterward, a sARIMA model was produced for high-power sample forecast, with a good performance, while for low-power sample any ARIMA model defeated persistence model; thus, a couple of nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural networks are proposed. Mean absolute error and mean square error are reported and demonstrate that the sARIMA model can predict satisfactorily high-power sample, even with limited data, while to forecast low-power sample, it is necessary to use a neural networks approach and all data available to produce accurate forecasts. In each case, a normalized comparison with persistence model is also reported. Finally, a method which uses previous data of daily output energy and forecasted future wind speed values from a numeric weather prediction model is presented to objectively identify whether the current time is in a high-power or low-power regime to choose the ad hoc daily output energy forecast model.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on finite volume methods. The finite volume method is a discretization method that is well suited for the numerical simulation of various types (for instance, elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic) of conservation laws; it has been extensively used in several engineering fields, such as fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, or petroleum engineering. Some of the important features of the finite volume method are similar to those of the finite element method: it may be used on arbitrary geometries, using structured or unstructured meshes, and it leads to robust schemes. The finite volume method is locally conservative because it is based on a “balance" approach: a local balance is written on each discretization cell that is often called “control volume;” by the divergence formula, an integral formulation of the fluxes over the boundary of the control volume is then obtained. The fluxes on the boundary are discretized with respect to the discrete unknowns.},

Lombardi, and the authors (2007) the ﬁnite element method was applied to a non-homogeneous Neumann problem on a cuspidal domain Ω ⊂ R2, and quasi-optimal order error estimates in the energy norm were obtained for certain graded meshes. In this paper, we study the error in the L2 norm obtaining similar results by using graded meshes of the type considered in that paper. Since many classical results in the theory Sobolev spaces do not apply to the domain under consideration, our estimates require a particular duality treatment working on appropriate weighted spaces. On the other hand, since the discrete domain Ωh veriﬁes Ω ⊂ Ωh, in the above-mentioned paper the source term of the Poisson problem was taken equal to 0 outside Ω in the variational discrete formulation. In this article we also consider the case in which this condition does not hold and obtain more general estimates, which can be useful in diﬀerent problems, for instance in the study of the eﬀect of numerical integration, or in eigenvalue approximations.},

	abstract = {Detecting objects and estimating their viewpoint in images are key tasks of 3D scene understanding. Recent approaches have achieved excellent results on very large benchmarks for object detection and viewpoint estimation. However, performances are still lagging behind for novel object categories with few samples. In this paper, we tackle the problems of few-shot object detection and few-shot viewpoint estimation. We propose a meta-learning framework that can be applied to both tasks, possibly including 3D data. Our models improve the results on objects of novel classes by leveraging on rich feature information originating from base classes with many samples. A simple joint feature embedding module is proposed to make the most of this feature sharing. Despite its simplicity, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on a range of datasets, including PASCAL VOC and MS COCO for few-shot object detection, and Pascal3D+ and ObjectNet3D for few-shot viewpoint estimation. And for the first time, we tackle the combination of both few-shot tasks, on Object- Net3D, showing promising results.

	abstract = {Reduced-basis methods (RB methods or RBMs) form one of the most promising techniques to deliver numerical solutions of parametrized PDEs in real-time with reasonable accuracy. For incompressible flow problems, RBMs based on LBB stable velocity–pressure spaces do not generally inherit the stability of the underlying high-fidelity model and, instead, additional stabilization techniques must be introduced. One way of bypassing the loss of LBB stability in the RBM is to inflate the velocity space with supremizer modes. This however deteriorates the performance of the RBM in the performance-critical online stage, as additional DOFs must be introduced to retain stability, while these DOFs do not effectively contribute to accuracy of the RB approximation. In this work we consider a velocity-only RB approximation, exploiting a solenoidal velocity basis. The solenoidal reduced basis emerges directly from the high-fidelity velocity solutions in the offline stage. By means of Piola transforms, the solenoidality of the velocity space is retained under geometric transformations, making the proposed RB method suitable also for the investigation of geometric parameters. To ensure exact solenoidality of the high-fidelity velocity solutions that constitute the RB, we consider approximations based on divergence-conforming compatible B-splines. We show that the velocity-only RB method leads to a significant improvement in computational efficiency in the online stage, and that the pressure solution can be recovered a posteriori at negligible extra cost. We illustrate the solenoidal RB approach by modeling steady two-dimensional Navier–Stokes flow around a NACA0015 airfoil at various angles of attack.},

The straightforward solution of such problems for ﬁne increments of is computationally prohibitive, particularly when Z is a large-scale matrix. This paper discusses an alternative solution approach based on the efﬁcient computation of u and its successive derivatives with respect to at a few sample values of this parameter, and the reconstruction of the solution u( ) in the frequency band of interest using multi-point Pade´ approximants. This computational methodology is illustrated with applications from structural dynamics and underwater acoustic scattering. In each case, it is shown to reduce the CPU time required by the straightforward approach to frequency sweep computations by two orders of magnitude. Copyright q 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Turbines in a wind farm dynamically influence each other through wakes. Therefore trade-offs exist between energy output of upstream turbines and the health of downstream turbines. Using both model-based predictive control (MPC) and machine learning techniques, existing works have explored the energy-fatigue trade-off either in a single turbine or only with few turbines due to issues of scalability and complexity. To address this gap, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based coordinated control for wind farms, called FALCON. FALCON addresses the multi-objective optimization problem of maximizing energy while minimizing fatigue damage by jointly controlling pitch and yaw of all turbines. FALCON achieves scale by using multiple reinforcement learning agents; capturing the global state-space efficiently using an auto-encoder; and pruning the action-space using domain knowledge. FALCON is evaluated through a real-world wind-farm case study with 21 turbines; and performs better than the default baseline PID controller and a learning-based distributed control.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks are surprisingly efficient at solving practical tasks, but the theory behind this phenomenon is only starting to catch up with the practice. Numerous works show that depth is the key to this efficiency. A certain class of deep convolutional networks – namely those that correspond to the Hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensor decomposition – has been proven to have exponentially higher expressive power than shallow networks. I.e. a shallow network of exponential width is required to realize the same score function as computed by the deep architecture. In this paper, we prove the expressive power theorem (an exponential lower bound on the width of the equivalent shallow network) for a class of recurrent neural networks – ones that correspond to the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition. This means that even processing an image patch by patch with an RNN can be exponentially more efficient than a (shallow) convolutional network with one hidden layer. Using theoretical results on the relation between the tensor decompositions we compare expressive powers of the HT- and TT-Networks. We also implement the recurrent TT-Networks and provide numerical evidence of their expressivity.},

In this work, we focus on spatial reasoning and explore the spatial understanding of neural models. First, we describe the following two spatial reasoning IQ tests: rotation and shape composition. Using well-defined rules, we constructed datasets that consist of various complexity levels. We designed a variety of experiments in terms of generalization, and evaluated six different baseline models on the newly generated datasets. We provide an analysis of the results and factors that affect the generalization abilities of models. Also, we analyze how neural models solve spatial reasoning tests with visual aids. We hope that our work can encourage further research into human-level spatial reasoning and provide a new direction for future work.},

	shorttitle = {Explicit dynamics isogeometric analysis},
	abstract = {IsoGeometric Analysis has shown to be a very promising tool for an integrated design and analysis process. A challenging task is still to move IGA from a proof of concept to a convenient design tool for industry and this work contributes to this endeavor. This work deals with the implementation of the IGA into Altair Radioss explicit finite element solver in order to address crash and stamping simulation applications. To this end, the necessary ingredients to a smooth integration of IGA in a traditional finite element code have been identified and adapted to the existing code architecture. A solid B-Spline element has been developed in Altair Radioss. The estimations of heuristic element and nodal stable time increment are explored to improve the accuracy of simulations and guarantee their stability. An existing contact interface has been extended in order to work seamlessly with both NURBS and Lagrange finite elements. As local refinement is needed for solution approximation, an analysis is made in terms of analysis suitability and implementation aspects for several Spline basis functions as Hierarchical B-Splines (HB-Splines), Truncated Hierarchical B-Splines (THB-Splines), T-Splines and Locally Refined B-Splines (LR B-Splines). The LR B-Spline basis is implemented. An improved refinement scheme is introduced and defines a set of analysis-suitable refinements to be used in Radioss. The refinement process of a regular coarse mesh is developed inside the solver. It allows the user to define a local refinement giving a set of instructions in the input file. The global solution is validated on industrial benchmarks, for validation cases conventionally used for industrial codes like stamping and drop test.},

To optimize the wind turbine layout for maximum efficiency, it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate the wake effect by distance. Using a nacelle LiDAR, it is possible to concurrently measure wind conditions at multiple positions. This study presents the results of analyzing the wake effects by distance, behind a 3 MW wind turbine, using a nacelle LiDAR. Wake wind data measured at 10 points by a nacelle LiDAR, mounted on the nacelle of a 1.5 MW downstream wind turbine, were analyzed against freestream wind data obtained from a 70-m-high met mast installed near the turbine. Variations in wind conditions in the wake region were analyzed as a function of distance and wind direction, and the influence of these factors on the power production of the downstream wind turbine was estimated using SCADA. The variations in wind speeds and turbulence intensities at multiple distances between 0.9D and 4.8D were quantitatively evaluated. Additionally, it was confirmed that the wake effects reduced the power performance by 23\% at 5.7D under a wind speed of 8.5 m/s.},

The locally refined (LR) B-splines that facilitate the local refinement are used as the basis functions for the approximations, while the kinematics of plates are described in terms of the Mindlin-Reissner plate theory. Appropriate enrichment functions for cracked plates are incorporated into the formulation to represent geometrically displacement discontinuities across the crack faces and singularity of the stress in the vicinity at the crack tips, thus cracks are modeled topologically independent of the computational mesh. Here we extend the Zienkiewicz-Zhu method-based error estimation to the XIGA formulation for cracks in Mindlin-Reissner plates such that non-smoothnesses and stress singularity are reflected accurately. We conduct the error-controlled adaptivity for local mesh refinement to enhance the accuracy and performance. Fracture parameters (i.e., mixed-mode intensity factors) are calculated through the contour interaction integral method in the context of Mindlin-Reissner plate theory. Several numerical examples for through-cracked plates are studied to show the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed formulation in modeling fracture of cracked moderately thick plates.},

	abstract = {We investigate the impact of adding inner nodes for a Filon-type method for highly oscillatory quadrature. The error of Filon-type method is composed of asymptotic and interpolation errors and the interplay between the two varies for diﬀerent frequencies. We are particularly concerned with two strategies for the choice of inner nodes: Clenshaw–Curtis points and zeros of an appropriate Jacobi polynomial. Once the frequency ω is large, the asymptotic error dominates, but the situation is altogether diﬀerent when ω ≥ 0 is small. In the ﬁrst regime our optimal error bounds indicate that Clenshaw–Curtis points are always marginally better, but this is reversed for small ω, then Jacobi points enjoy an advantage. The main tool in our analysis is the Peano Kernel Theorem (PKT).},

State-of-the-art research in physical processes using simulations, the training of neural networks for deep learning, or the analysis of big data are all dependent on the availability of sufficient and performant computational resources. For such research, access to a high-performance computing infrastructure is indispensable. Many scientific workloads from such research domains are inherently parallel and can benefit from the data-parallel architecture of general purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs). However, GPGPU resources are scarce at Norway's national infrastructure. EPIC is a GPGPU enabled computing research infrastructure at NTNU. It enables NTNU's researchers to perform experiments that otherwise would be impossible, as time-to-solution would simply take too long.},

The proposed method can estimate the error of solutions obtained by the finite element method for two-dimensional elastic problems with 4-node elements. Since the error is estimated element by element, the proposed method does not require a large memory or long computing time. Not only rectangular elements but also arbitrarily shaped 4-node elements can be used in this method for estimating the error in the finite element computation with high accuracy. The finite element solutions are improved by adding the estimated errors onto the original solutions. The proposed method can be utilized for any type of linear problem if an isoparametric finite element method is used.},

	abstract = {The paper presents an efficient 88 line MATLAB code for topology optimization. It has been developed using the 99 line code presented by Sigmund (Struct Multidisc Optim 21(2):120–127, 2001) as a starting point. The original code has been extended by a density filter, and a considerable improvement in efficiency has been achieved, mainly by preallocating arrays and vectorizing loops. A speed improvement with a factor of 100 is obtained for a benchmark example with 7,500 elements. Moreover, the length of the code has been reduced to a mere 88 lines. These improvements have been accomplished without sacrificing the readability of the code. The 88 line code can therefore be considered as a valuable successor to the 99 line code, providing a practical instrument that may help to ease the learning curve for those entering the field of topology optimization. The paper also discusses simple extensions of the basic code to include recent PDE-based and black-and-white projection filtering methods. The complete 88 line code is included as an appendix and can be downloaded from the web site www.topopt.dtu.dk.},

	abstract = {Boundary integral analysis of scattering from rigid bodies is well known. Analysis often proceeds along the following lines: representation of the geometry using a collection of triangles, representation of physics using low order ansatz functions deﬁned on each triangle, and then solving the resulting discrete system. This prescription for the common solution stands out in terms of the low-order approximation of both geometry and representation of physics; speciﬁcally, both are C0. Taking inspiration from computer graphics literature, a framework wherein continuity of representation (both geometry and physics) can be as high as C2 is developed. In this paper, the steps necessary to develop such a iso-geometric (i.e., using the same basis functions for representing both geometry and physics) boundary integral solver are elucidated. In doing so, an efﬁcient method based on a wideband fast multipole method to evaluate the required inner products and matrix vector products is proposed and demonstrated. Numerous examples are presented to highlight the beneﬁts of the proposed approach. VC 2020 Acoustical Society of America.},

The procedures allow not only the final global energy norm error to be well estimated using hierarchic p-refinement, but in addition give a nearly optimal mesh. The design of this is guided by the local information computed on the previous mesh. The desired accuracy can always be obtained within one or at most two h–p-refinements. The rate of convergence of the adaptive h–p-version analysis procedures has been tested for some examples and found to be very strong. The presented procedures can easily be incorporated into existing p- or h-type code structures.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the method of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) for robustly separating video frames into background (low-rank) and foreground (sparse) components in real-time. The method is a novel application of a technique used for characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in an equation-free manner by decomposing the state of the system into low-rank terms whose Fourier components in time are known. DMD terms with Fourier frequencies near the origin (zero-modes) are interpreted as background (low-rank) portions of the given video frames, and the terms with Fourier frequencies bounded away from the origin are their sparse counterparts. An approximate low-rank/sparse separation is achieved at the computational cost of just one singular value decomposition and one linear equation solve, thus producing results orders of magnitude faster than a leading separation method, namely robust principal component analysis (RPCA). The DMD method that is developed here is demonstrated to work robustly in real-time with personal laptop-class computing power and without any parameter tuning, which is a transformative improvement in performance that is ideal for video surveillance and recognition applications.},

	abstract = {The Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a spatio-temporal matrix decomposition method capable of background modeling in video streams. DMD is a regression technique that integrates Fourier transforms and singular value decomposition. Innovations in compressed sensing allow for a scalable and rapid decomposition of video streams that scales with the intrinsic rank of the matrix, rather than the size of the actual video. Our results show that the quality of the resulting background model is competitive, quantified by the F-measure, recall and precision. A GPU (graphics processing unit) accelerated implementation is also possible allowing the algorithm to operate efficiently on streaming data. In addition, it is possible to leverage the native compressed format of many data streams, such as HD video and computational physics codes that are represented sparsely in the Fourier domain, to massively reduce data transfer from CPU to GPU and to enable sparse matrix multiplications.},

Error/Accuracy Measurement Given that predictions are generated for a large number sites and using a large number of method combinations, using a non-standardized measure of error like, for instance, MSE (Mean Standard Error) is not practical because the error values for each site would depend on the specific range of values contained in the time series measures, so it would be statistically challenging to compare results between different sites. ...]of this comparison, a research question arises.

Our method, named DPOD (Dense Pose Object Detector), estimates dense multi-class 2D-3D correspondence maps between an input image and available 3D models. Given the correspondences, a 6DoF pose is computed via PnP and RANSAC. An additional RGB pose refinement of the initial pose estimates is performed using a custom deep learning-based refinement scheme. Our results and comparison to a vast number of related works demonstrate that a large number of correspondences is beneficial for obtaining high-quality 6D poses both before and after refinement. Unlike other methods that mainly use real data for training and do not train on synthetic renderings, we perform evaluation on both synthetic and real training data demonstrating superior results before and after refinement when compared to all recent detectors. While being precise, the presented approach is still real-time capable.},

The traditional method of thermoelectric material discovery from an almost limitless search space of chemical compounds involves expensive and time consuming experiments. In the current work, the density functional theory (DFT) simulations are used to compute the descriptors (features) and thermoelectric characteristics (labels) of a set of compounds. The DFT simulations are computationally very expensive and hence the database is not very exhaustive. With an anticipation that the important features can be learned by machine learning (ML) from the limited database and the knowledge could be used to predict the behavior of any new compound, the current work adds knowledge related to (a) understanding the impact of selection of influence of training/test data, (b) influence of complexity of ML algorithms, and (c) computational efficiency of combined DFT-ML methodology.},

During operation and for service first simulation-based solutions are realized for optimized operations and failure prediction. In this sense, simulation merges the physical and virtual world in all life cycle phases.

	abstract = {Digital twin (DT) is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in various industries. It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the “softwarization” of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.},

In this regard, digitalization is disrupting the wind section thanks to the development of advanced sensors, automated equipment, computational power, among other. All these allow to optimize and simplify different parts of the offshore wind power plant development (i.e. design, planning, installation, O\&M, etc.). This fact is of special interest on maintenance, since the early detection of failures or malfunctions lead to reduced costly corrective maintenance. This paper presents a literature review of current state-of-the-art on the application of digitalization activities which can be applied for floating wind, including typical component failures, monitoring techniques and advanced digital tools as Digital Twin concept and Building Information Models (BIM). Finally, the review paper provides an analysis of existing gaps, needs and challenges of the sector to provide guides on research and innovation to foster offshore wind sector.},

These methods rely heavily on insights into the mathematical model governing the physical system. However, in complex systems, such as autonomous underwater vehicles performing the dual objective of path following and collision avoidance, decision making becomes nontrivial. We propose a solution using state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to develop autonomous agents capable of achieving this hybrid objective without having a priori knowledge about the goal or the environment. Our results demonstrate the viability of DRL in path following and avoiding collisions towards achieving human-level decision making in autonomous vehicle systems within extreme obstacle configurations.},

	abstract = {In this work, we introduce, justify and demonstrate the Corrective Source Term Approach (CoSTA)—a novel approach to Hybrid Analysis and Modeling (HAM). The objective of HAM is to combine physics-based modeling (PBM) and data-driven modeling (DDM) to create generalizable, trustworthy, accurate, computationally efficient and self-evolving models. CoSTA achieves this objective by augmenting the governing equation of a PBM model with a corrective source term generated using a deep neural network. In a series of numerical experiments on one-dimensional heat diffusion, CoSTA is found to outperform comparable DDM and PBM models in terms of accuracy – often reducing predictive errors by several orders of magnitude – while also generalizing better than pure DDM. Due to its flexible but solid theoretical foundation, CoSTA provides a modular framework for leveraging novel developments within both PBM and DDM. Its theoretical foundation also ensures that CoSTA can be used to model any system governed by (deterministic) partial differential equations. Moreover, CoSTA facilitates interpretation of the DNN-generated source term within the context of PBM, which results in improved explainability of the DNN. These factors make CoSTA a potential door-opener for data-driven techniques to enter high-stakes applications previously reserved for pure PBM.},

	abstract = {An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives.“Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.”—Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.},

	abstract = {Recent research on problem formulations based on decomposition into low-rank plus sparse matrices shows a suitable framework to separate moving objects from the background. The most representative problem formulation is the Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) solved via Principal Component Pursuit (PCP) which decomposes a data matrix in a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix. However, similar robust implicit or explicit decompositions can be made in the following problem formulations: Robust Non-negative Matrix Factorization (RNMF), Robust Matrix Completion (RMC), Robust Subspace Recovery (RSR), Robust Subspace Tracking (RST) and Robust Low-Rank Minimization (RLRM). The main goal of these similar problem formulations is to obtain explicitly or implicitly a decomposition into low-rank matrix plus additive matrices. In this context, this work aims to initiate a rigorous and comprehensive review of the similar problem formulations in robust subspace learning and tracking based on decomposition into low-rank plus additive matrices for testing and ranking existing algorithms for background/foreground separation. For this, we first provide a preliminary review of the recent developments in the different problem formulations which allows us to define a unified view that we called Decomposition into Low-rank plus Additive Matrices (DLAM). Then, we examine carefully each method in each robust subspace learning/tracking frameworks with their decomposition, their loss functions, their optimization problem and their solvers. Furthermore, we investigate if incremental algorithms and real-time implementations can be achieved for background/foreground separation. Finally, experimental results on a large-scale dataset called Background Models Challenge (BMC 2012) show the comparative performance of 32 different robust subspace learning/tracking methods.},

	abstract = {Traditional active noise control (ANC) methods are based on adaptive signal processing with the least mean square algorithm as the foundation. They are linear systems and do not perform satisfactorily in the presence of nonlinear distortions. In this paper, we formulate ANC as a supervised learning problem and propose a deep learning approach, called deep ANC, to address the nonlinear ANC problem. The main idea is to employ deep learning to encode the optimal control parameters corresponding to different noises and environments. A convolutional recurrent network (CRN) is trained to estimate the real and imaginary spectrograms of the canceling signal from the reference signal so that the corresponding anti-noise can eliminate or attenuate the primary noise in the ANC system. Large-scale multi-condition training is employed to achieve good generalization and robustness against a variety of noises. The deep ANC method can be trained to achieve active noise cancellation no matter whether the reference signal is noise or noisy speech. In addition, a delay-compensated strategy is introduced to solve the potential latency problem of ANC systems. Experimental results show that deep ANC is effective for wideband noise reduction and generalizes well to untrained noises. Moreover, the proposed method can achieve ANC within a quiet zone and is robust against variations in reference signals.},

The aim is to represent the sea bottom with good accuracy and at the same time reduce the data size considerably. In this process the point clouds must be cleaned by selecting the "best" points for surface generation. This cleaning process is called deconfliction, and we use a rough approximation of the combined point clouds as a reference surface to select a consistent set of points. The reference surface is updated with the selected points to create an accurate approximation. LR B-splines is the selected surface format due to its suitability for adaptive refinement and approximation, and its ability to represent local detail without a global increase in the data size of the surface},

	abstract = {Abstract Virtual sensing enables estimation of stress in unmeasured locations of a system using a system model, physical sensors and a process model. The system model holds the relationship between the physical sensors and the desired stress response. A process model processes both the physical sensors and the system model to synthesise virtual sensors that ‘measure’ the desired stress response. Thus, virtual sensing enables mapping between the physical sensors (input) and the desired stress response (output). The system model is a mathematical model of the system based on knowledge or data of the system. Here, the data-driven system model is constructed directly on data analyses for the specific system. In this paper, supervised learning and data-driven system models are applied to strain estimation of an offshore wind turbine in the dynamic range through a novel use of principal component analysis (PCA); 40 min of training data is used to establish the data-driven system model that can estimate the dynamic strain response with high precision for 2 months, while the estimated fatigue damage averaged out to −1.76\% of the measured strain response.},

As the speed of information growth exceeds Moore’s Law at the beginning of this new century, excessive data is making great troubles to human beings. However, there are so much potential and highly useful values hidden in the huge volume of data. A new scientific paradigm is born as data-intensive scientific discovery (DISD), also known as Big Data problems. A large number of fields and sectors, ranging from economic and business activities to public administration, from national security to scientific researches in many areas, involve with Big Data problems. On the one hand, Big Data is extremely valuable to produce productivity in businesses and evolutionary breakthroughs in scientific disciplines, which give us a lot of opportunities to make great progresses in many fields. There is no doubt that the future competitions in business productivity and technologies will surely converge into the Big Data explorations. On the other hand, Big Data also arises with many challenges, such as difficulties in data capture, data storage, data analysis and data visualization. This paper is aimed to demonstrate a close-up view about Big Data, including Big Data applications, Big Data opportunities and challenges, as well as the state-of-the-art techniques and technologies we currently adopt to deal with the Big Data problems. We also discuss several underlying methodologies to handle the data deluge, for example, granular computing, cloud computing, bio-inspired computing, and quantum computing.},

The enormous data sets now routinely encountered in the sciences provide an incentive to develop mathematical techniques and computational algorithms that help synthesize, interpret and give meaning to the data in the context of its scientific setting. A specific aim of this book is to integrate standard scientific computing methods with data analysis. By doing so, it brings together, in a self-consistent fashion, the key ideas from: · statistics, · time-frequency analysis, and · low-dimensional reductions The blend of these ideas provides meaningful insight into the data sets one is faced with in every scientific subject today, including those generated from complex dynamical systems. This is a particularly exciting field and much of the final part of the book is driven by intuitive examples from it, showing how the three areas can be used in combination to give critical insight into the fundamental workings of various problems. Data-Driven Modeling and Scientific Computation is a survey of practical numerical solution techniques for ordinary and partial differential equations as well as algorithms for data manipulation and analysis. Emphasis is on the implementation of numerical schemes to practical problems in the engineering, biological and physical sciences. An accessible introductory-to-advanced text, this book fully integrates MATLAB and its versatile and high-level programming functionality, while bringing together computational and data skills for both undergraduate and graduate students in scientific computing.},

	abstract = {Governing equations are essential to the study of physical systems, providing models that can generalize to predict previously unseen behaviors. There are many systems of interest across disciplines where large quantities of data have been collected, but the underlying governing equations remain unknown. This work introduces an approach to discover governing models from data. The proposed method addresses a key limitation of prior approaches by simultaneously discovering coordinates that admit a parsimonious dynamical model. Developing parsimonious and interpretable governing models has the potential to transform our understanding of complex systems, including in neuroscience, biology, and climate science.The discovery of governing equations from scientific data has the potential to transform data-rich fields that lack well-characterized quantitative descriptions. Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam’s razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.},

	abstract = {A curved shell finite element formulation for elastostatics is presented in which the element displacement field approximation in the shell thickness direction can be of an arbitrary desired polynomial order p, thereby permitting strain of at least p−1 order. This is accomplished by introducing additional degrees of freedom in the element displacement field approximation corresponding to the Lagrange interpolating polynomials in the direction of the element thickness. These elements have the important hierarchical property, i.e. the element approximation functions, nodal degrees of freedom, stiffness matrix and equivalent nodal load vectors corresponding to an approximation order p are a subset of those corresponding to the approximation order (p + 1). The formulation ensures C0 continuity across the interelement boundaries. The element geometry is defined using the coordinates of the nodes lying on the middle surface of the element and the nodal point normals to the middle surface. The element displacement approximation consists of hierarchical approximation functions, nodal displacements and the first and the higher derivatives of the displacements at the nodes corresponding to the Lagrange interpolating polynomials (which are complete) in the direction of the shell thickness. The quadratic functional or the total potential energy functional is constructed using the energy approach. The element properties are derived by substituting the hierarchical element displacement approximation into the quadratic functional and then minimizing it with respect to nodal variables or the nodal degrees of freedom. The resulting element stiffness matrix and the equivalent generalized nodal force vectors due to body forces, distributed pressure loads and thermal loadings are all hierarchical. This formulation permits any desired order of displacement approximation in the direction of the shell thickness without remodeling. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, modeling convenience, faster rate of convergence and overall superiority of the present formulation over the existing shell and plate elements based on conventional theories as well as various higher order deformation theories. The results obtained from the present p-approximation shell finite element models are compared with analytical solutions. The h-approximation results (using three thick shells and three-dimensional solids) are also presented for comparison purposes.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new curved shell finite element formulation for linear static analysis of laminated composite plates and shells, where the displacement approximation in the direction of the shell thickness can be of an arbitrary polynomial order p, thereby permitting strains of at least (p - 1) order. This is accomplished by introducing additional nodal variables in the element displacement approximation corresponding to the Lagrange interpolating polynomials in the element thickness direction. The resulting element displacement approximation has an important hierarchical property i.e. the approximation functions and the generalized nodal variables corresponding to an approximation order p are a subset of those corresponding to an approximation order (p + 1). The element formulation ensures C0 continuity or smoothness of displacements across the interelement boundaries. The element properties (stiffness matrix and equivalent load vectors) are derived using the principle of virtual work and the hierarchical element approximation. The formulation is extended for generally orthotropic material behaviour where the material directions are not necessarily parallel to the global axes. Further extension of this formulation for laminated composites is accomplished by incorporating the material properties of each lamina by numerically integrating the element stiffness matrix for each lamina. The formulation has no restriction on either the number of laminas or the layup pattern of the laminas. Each lamina can be generally orthotropic, and the material directions and the lamina thicknesses may vary from point to point within each lamina. The geometry of the laminated shell element is described by the co-ordinates of the nodes lying on the middle surface of the element and the lamina thicknesses at each node. The formulation permits any desired order displacement or strain approximation in the shell thickness direction without remodelling. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and overall superiority of the present formulation. The results obtained from the present formulation are compared with those available in the literature as well as the analytical solutions.},

Convergence of adaptive schemes to the correct solution, however, is so far only understood for certain kind of diﬀerential equations. In general, it cannot be excluded that the adaptive algorithm computes a convergent sequence of discrete approximations with a limit which is not the correct solution. This work proposes a feedback loop which guarantees the convergence of the computed discrete approximations to the correct solution. Although stated for Symm’s integral equation of the ﬁrst kind, the main part of this work is written for a general audience in the context of weak forms as Riesz representations in Hilbert spaces. Numerical examples illustrate the adaptive strategies.},

Artificial neural networks commonly transform the weighted sum of inputs to describe overall similarity relationships of trained and new testing input patterns. Differential polynomial neural networks form a new class of neural networks, which construct and solve an unknown general partial differential equation of a function of interest with selected substitution relative terms using non-linear multi-variable composite polynomials. The layers of the network generate simple and composite relative substitution terms whose convergent series combinations can describe partial dependent derivative changes of the input variables. This regression is based on trained generalized partial derivative data relations, decomposed into a multi-layer polynomial network structure. The sigmoidal function, commonly used as a nonlinear activation of artificial neurons, may transform some polynomial items together with the parameters with the aim to improve the polynomial derivative term series ability to approximate complicated periodic functions, as simple low order polynomials are not able to fully make up for the complete cycles. The similarity analysis facilitates substitutions for differential equations or can form dimensional units from data samples to describe real-world problems.},

	abstract = {Abstract Wind turbine fatigue estimation is based on time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations for various wind conditions, followed by cycle-counting procedures and the application of engineering damage models. The outputs of the fatigue simulations are large in volume and of high dimensionality, as they typically consist of estimates on finite-element computational meshes. The strain and stress tensor time series, which are the primary quantities of interest when considering the problem of fatigue estimation, are dictated by complex vibration characteristics due to the coupled effect of aerodynamics, structural dynamics, geometrically non-linear mechanics, and control. A Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) is trained in order to model the probability distribution of the accumulated fatigue on the root cross-section of a simulated wind turbine blade. The VAE is conditioned on historical data that correspond to coarse wind-field measurement statistics, such as mean hub-height wind speed, standard deviation of hub-height wind speed and shear exponent. In the absence of direct measurements of structural loads, the proposed technique finds applications in making long-term probabilistic deterioration predictions from historical Supervisory, Control, and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data, while capturing the inherent aleatoric uncertainty due to the incomplete information on strain time series of the wind turbine structure, when only SCADA data statistics are available.},

There has been a lot of activity in the development of both hardware and software in 3D imaging systems which will have a huge impact in the capabilities of robotics. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the state of the art in range imaging sensors as well as some emerging technologies. For example, Time of Flight (ToF) cameras with improved resolution and latency, low cost LiDAR, and the fusion of range imaging technologies will empower robotics with greater perception capabilities. Likewise, software approaches will be reviewed with a focus on Deep Learning approaches which are now the leading edge in data analysis and further enhancing the capabilities of intelligent robotic systems using 3D imaging. The emergence of Geometric Deep Learning for 3D computer vision in robotics will also be detailed, with a focus on object registration, object detection and semantic segmentation. Foreseeable trends which have been identified in both hardware and software aspects of 3D computer vision are also discussed.},

The present model consists of coupling the most important chemothermo-mechanical processes to describe temperature evolution, variation of hydration degree, and mechanical behavior. The changes of material properties are expressed as a function of the hydration degree, to capture the age effects. Fracture analysis of these processes is then accommodated by a versatile phase field model in the framework of smeared crack models, addressing the influence of cracks on hydration and thermal transfer. We additionally describe a stable and robust numerical algorithm, which aims to solve coupled problems by using a staggered scheme. The developed approach is applied to study the fracture phenomena for both homogeneous and heterogeneous concrete structures. Especially, in the second case, all microstructural heterogeneities of sand and cement matrix are explicitly accounted. Nucleation, initiation, and propagation of complex crack network are simulated in an efficient way demonstrating the potential of the proposed approach to assess the early-age defects in concrete structures and materials.},

The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a regression technique that integrates two of the leading data analysis methods in use today: Fourier transforms and singular value decomposition. Borrowing ideas from compressed sensing and matrix sketching, cDMD eases the computational workload of high resolution video processing. The key principal of cDMD is to obtain the decomposition on a (small) compressed matrix representation of the video feed. Hence, the cDMD algorithm scales with the intrinsic rank of the matrix, rather then the size of the actual video (data) matrix. Selection of the optimal modes characterizing the background is formulated as a sparsity-constrained sparse coding problem. Our results show, that the quality of the resulting background model is competitive, quantified by the F-measure, Recall and Precision. A GPU (graphics processing unit) accelerated implementation is also presented which further boosts the computational efficiency of the algorithm.},

Namely, a new type of numerical model, a complex hybrid environmental model based on a synergetic combination of deterministic and machine learning model components, has been introduced. Conceptual and practical possibilities of developing hybrid models are discussed in this paper for applications to climate modeling and weather prediction. The approach presented here uses NN as a statistical or machine learning technique to develop highly accurate and fast emulations for time consuming model physics components (model physics parameterizations). The NN emulations of the most time consuming model physics components, short and long wave radiation parameterizations or full model radiation, presented in this paper are combined with the remaining deterministic components (like model dynamics) of the original complex environmental model—a general circulation model or global climate model (GCM)—to constitute a hybrid GCM (HGCM). The parallel GCM and HGCM simulations produce very similar results but HGCM is significantly faster. The speed-up of model calculations opens the opportunity for model improvement. Examples of developed HGCMs illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the new approach for modeling complex multidimensional interdisciplinary systems.},

	abstract = {A completely hierarchical p-version finite element formulation is presented for an axisymmetric shell element for heat conduction in laminated composites, where the element temperature field can be of arbitrary polynomial orders pξ and pη in the longitudinal (ξ) and the transverse (η) directions of the shell element. The approximation functions and the corresponding nodal variables for the axisymmetric shell element are derived by first constructing the one-dimensional hierarchical approximation functions of orders pξ and pη and the corresponding hierarchical nodal variable operators for each of the two directions ξ and η and then taking their product (sometimes called the tensor product). This procedure gives the approximation functions and the nodal variables for the axisymmetric shell element that correspond to the polynomial orders pξ and pη. The element approximation functions and the nodal variables are both hierarchical and therefore the element matrices and the vectors corresponding to orders pξ and pη are a subset of those corresponding to the polynomial orders (pξ + 1) and (pη + 1). The formulation ensures C0 continuity across the interelement boundaries. The geometry of the element is described in the usual way by the Cartesian coordinates of the nodes located at the middle surface (η = 0) of the element and the nodal vectors representing nodal values of the lamina thicknesses. Weak formulation of the Fourier heat conduction equation for globally orthotropic material is constructed in the cylindrical coordinate system rz. The element properties are derived using the weak formulation (or the associated quadratic functional) and the hierarchical element approximation. This formulation is extended for generally orthotropic material behavior where the material directions are not necessarily parallel to the global axes. Further extension of the formulation for laminated composites is accomplished by incorporating the material properties of each layer through numerical integration of the element matrix for each layer. The element matrices and the equivalent heat vectors (due to convection, distributed heat flux and internal heat generation) are all hierarchical. The formulation permits any desired order temperature distribution in the ξ and η directions without remodeling. There is no restriction on the number of layers and the lay up pattern of the layers. Each layer can be generally orthotropic. The material directions and the layer thicknesses may vary from point to point within each layer. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and overall superiority of the present formulation. For all examples, h-model results using isoparametric elements are also presented. Comparisons are made with analytical solutions wherever possible.},

	abstract = {Upcoming technologies like digital twins, autonomous, and artificial intelligent systems involving safety–critical applications require accurate, interpretable, computationally efficient, and generalizable models. Unfortunately, the two most commonly used modeling approaches, physics-based modeling (PBM) and data-driven modeling (DDM) struggle to satisfy all these requirements. In the current work, we demonstrate how a hybrid approach combining the best of PBM and DDM can result in models that can outperform both of them. We do so by combining partial differential equations based on first principles describing partially known physics with a black box DDM, in this case, a deep neural network model compensating for the unknown physics. The novelty of the work is in the theoretical contribution of presenting a sound mathematical argument for why the approach should work. The argument is backed by an array of experiments involving a two-dimensional heat diffusion problem with unknown source terms. The hybrid approach demonstrates the method’s superior performance in accuracy and generalizability. Additionally, it is shown how the DDM part can be interpreted within the hybrid framework to make the overall approach reliable. The approach, as we see, will be a door opener for underutilized DDMs in high stake applications.},

	abstract = {Path Following and Collision Avoidance, be it for unmanned surface vessels or other autonomous vehicles, are two fundamental guidance problems in robotics. For many decades, they have been subject to academic study, leading to a vast number of proposed approaches. However, they have mostly been treated as separate problems, and have typically relied on non-linear first-principles models with parameters that can only be determined experimentally. The rise of deep reinforcement learning in recent years suggests an alternative approach: end-to-end learning of the optimal guidance policy from scratch by means of a trial-and-error based approach. In this article, we explore the potential of Proximal Policy Optimization, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm with demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on Continuous Control tasks, when applied to the dual-objective problem of controlling an autonomous surface vehicle in a COLREGs compliant manner such that it follows an a priori known desired path while avoiding collisions with other vessels along the way. Based on high-fidelity elevation and AIS tracking data from the Trondheim Fjord, an inlet of the Norwegian sea, we evaluate the trained agent's performance in challenging, dynamic real-world scenarios where the ultimate success of the agent rests upon its ability to navigate non-uniform marine terrain while handling challenging, but realistic vessel encounters.},

But for computational reasons, conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes cannot be used directly on a grid fine enough to resolve all scales found in a city. For this, we use mesoscale models, variants of CFD codes in which the 3D conservation equations are solved on grids having a resolution of a few kilometers. At this resolution, the effects of subgrid scales need implicit representations. In other words, phenomena such as momentum and energy exchanges averaged over the mesoscale grid contribute necessary sources/sinks to the corresponding equations. Such spatial averaging results in additional terms called dispersive fluxes. Until now these fluxes have been ignored. To better understand these fluxes, we have conducted large eddy simulations (LESs) over an array of cubes for different inter-cube spacings. The study shows that these fluxes are as important as the turbulent fluxes and exhibit trends which are related to the eddy formations inside the canopies.},

The paper starts with a brief description of the governing equations, their numerical discretization and the safety criteria used by the aviation industry to classify turbulence as mild or extreme. Directional dependence of the flow characteristics in the region is studied followed by an attempt to validate the experience of the pilots operating in the region.

This is the main message of this paper, which introduces an automated pipeline with pixels as inputs and 3D surfaces of various rigid categories as outputs in images of realistic scenes. At the core of our approach are deformable 3D models that can be learned from 2D annotations available in existing object detection datasets, that can be driven by noisy automatic object segmentations and which we complement with a bottom-up module for recovering high-frequency shape details. We perform a comprehensive quantitative analysis and ablation study of our approach using the recently introduced PASCAL 3D+ dataset and show very encouraging automatic reconstructions on PASCAL VOC.},

There are significant advantages of broadband sound over traditional narrowband sound, including improvements in range resolution and in classification and discrimination of scatterers. The bioacoustics team at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) has been working for the past 20 years developing new techniques in this area. The techniques involve signal processing, scattering theory, laboratory methods, and advanced field instrumentation. The work principally involves biological sound scatterers such as fish and zooplankton, however research has also been conducted involving physical microstructure, benthic shells, and sediment interfaces of the seafloor. This paper briefly summarizes these advances made at WHOI. Citations to WHOI-based research are given, which also include citations to other research conducted in the field outside WHOI.},

	doi = {10.1109/WACV.2014.6836101},
	abstract = {3D object detection and pose estimation methods have become popular in recent years since they can handle ambiguities in 2D images and also provide a richer description for objects compared to 2D object detectors. However, most of the datasets for 3D recognition are limited to a small amount of images per category or are captured in controlled environments. In this paper, we contribute PASCAL3D+ dataset, which is a novel and challenging dataset for 3D object detection and pose estimation. PASCAL3D+ augments 12 rigid categories of the PASCAL VOC 2012 [4] with 3D annotations. Furthermore, more images are added for each category from ImageNet [3]. PASCAL3D+ images exhibit much more variability compared to the existing 3D datasets, and on average there are more than 3,000 object instances per category. We believe this dataset will provide a rich testbed to study 3D detection and pose estimation and will help to significantly push forward research in this area. We provide the results of variations of DPM [6] on our new dataset for object detection and viewpoint estimation in different scenarios, which can be used as baselines for the community. Our benchmark is available online at http://cvgl.stanford.edu/projects/pascal3d.},

	shorttitle = {{BB8}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10896},
	abstract = {We introduce a novel method for 3D object detection and pose estimation from color images only. We first use segmentation to detect the objects of interest in 2D even in presence of partial occlusions and cluttered background. By contrast with recent patch-based methods, we rely on a "holistic" approach: We apply to the detected objects a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to predict their 3D poses in the form of 2D projections of the corners of their 3D bounding boxes. This, however, is not sufficient for handling objects from the recent T-LESS dataset: These objects exhibit an axis of rotational symmetry, and the similarity of two images of such an object under two different poses makes training the CNN challenging. We solve this problem by restricting the range of poses used for training, and by introducing a classifier to identify the range of a pose at run-time before estimating it. We also use an optional additional step that refines the predicted poses. We improve the state-of-the-art on the LINEMOD dataset from 73.7\% to 89.3\% of correctly registered RGB frames. We are also the first to report results on the Occlusion dataset using color images only. We obtain 54\% of frames passing the Pose 6D criterion on average on several sequences of the T-LESS dataset, compared to the 67\% of the state-of-the-art on the same sequences which uses both color and depth. The full approach is also scalable, as a single network can be trained for multiple objects simultaneously.},

In the article the Balanced Readiness Level assessment (BRLa) methodology is employed and illustrated on 1) a set of 36 novel agricultural technologies, and 2) on the development of a technology for virtual agricultural fences. The empirical applications in this article indicates that the BRLa- methodology may serve as a fruitful approach for a compound assessment of emerging technologies.

	abstract = {A popular method to detect anomalous behaviour or specific failures in wind turbine sensor data uses a specific type of neural network called an autoencoder. These models have proven to be very successful in detecting such deviations, yet cannot show the underlying cause or failure directly. Such information is necessary for the implementation of these models in the planning of maintenance actions. In this paper we introduce a novel method: ARCANA. We use ARCANA to identify the possible root causes of anomalies detected by an autoencoder. It describes the process of reconstruction as an optimisation problem that aims to remove anomalous properties from an anomaly considerably. This reconstruction must be similar to the anomaly and thus identify only a few, but highly explanatory anomalous features, in the sense of Ockham’s razor. The proposed method is applied on an open data set of wind turbine sensor data, where an artificial error was added onto the wind speed sensor measurements to acquire a controlled test environment. The results are compared with the reconstruction errors of the autoencoder output. The ARCANA method points out the wind speed sensor correctly with a significantly higher feature importance than the other features, whereas using the non-optimised reconstruction error does not. Even though the deviation in one specific input feature is very large, the reconstruction error of many other features is large as well, complicating the interpretation of the detected anomaly. Additionally, we apply ARCANA to a set of offshore wind turbine data. Two case studies are discussed, demonstrating the technical relevance of ARCANA.},

	abstract = {Hydrated soft tissues of the human musculoskeletal system, such as articular cartilage in diarthrodial joints or the annulus fibrosis of the inter vertebral disk, are accurately represented by a biphasic continuum model consisting of an incompressible solid phase (collagen and proteoglycan) and incompressible, inviscid fluid (interstitial fluid) and derive from the continuum theory of mixtures. These tissues exhibit a viscoelastic-type response which is caused by the diffusive drag of the fluid phase as it flows past the solid phase. In this study an automated, adaptive, finite element solution of the governing biphasic equations is presented. The finite element formulation is based on a mixed-penalty approach in which the penalty form of the continuity equation for the mixture is included in the weak form. Pressure, solid and fluid velocities are interpolated independently, and the coefficients of the C−1 pressure field are eliminated at the element level. The resulting matrix form is a system of first order differential equations which is solved via standard finite difference methods. Mesh generation and updating, including both refinement and coarsening, for the two-dimensional examples examined in this study are performed using Finite Quadtree. The adaptive analysis is based on an error indicator which is the L2 norm of the difference between the finite element solution and a projected finite element solution. Total stress, calculated as the sum of the solid and fluid phase stresses, is used in the error indicator. Rezoning is accomplished by transferring the finite element solution for the primary variables onto the locally updated mesh using a projected field. These projected values allow the finite difference algorithm to proceed in time using the updated mesh. The accuracy and effectiveness of this adaptive finite element analysis is demonstrated using two-dimensional axisymmetric problems corresponding to the uncomined compression of a cylindrical disk of soft tissue and the indentation of a thin sheet of soft tissue. The method is shown to effectively capture the steep gradients in both problems and to produce solutions in good agreement with independent, converged, numerical solutions.},

Extremum seeking control (ESC) is one strategy that holds promise for reducing this impact under certain wind input conditions. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of ESC under different turbulence conditions, describing methods for addressing the complexities caused by the turbulent wind input and time-varying delay of the wind between turbines, where these two elements are the most important contributions compared to other wind farm control research. The results show that energy capture can be increased in low turbulence intensity conditions, but perhaps not in high turbulence conditions.},

The modified modeling procedure is applied to model 10 minute average measured wind-speed data from three locations in the Baltic Sea area and the results show that the procedure can capture time correlation and probability distribution of the data. In addition, it is shown that, for 10-min average wind-speed data in the Baltic Sea area, it could be sufficient to use ARIMA(6,0,0) and ARIMA(0,1,6) to model the HF and LF components of the data, respectively. It is also shown that, in the Baltic Sea area, a model developed for an observed wind-speed data at one location could be used to simulate wind-speed data at a nearby location where only the average wind-speed is known.},

	abstract = {With the rise of focus on man made changes to our planet and wildlife therein, more and more emphasis is put on sustainable and responsible gathering of resources. In an effort to preserve maritime wildlife the Norwegian government decided to create an overview of the presence and abundance of various species of marine lives in the Norwegian fjords and oceans. The current work evaluates the possibility of utilizing machine learning methods in particular the You Only Look Once version 3 algorithm to detect fish in challenging conditions characterized by low light, undesirable algae growth and high noise. It was found that the algorithm trained on images collected during the day time under natural light could detect fish successfully in images collected during night under artificial lighting. The overall average precision score of 88\% was achieved. Later principal component analysis was used to analyze the features learned in different layers of the network. It is concluded that for the purpose of object detection in specific application areas, the network can be considerably simplified since many of the feature detector turns our to be redundant.},

	abstract = {Rotating wind turbine blades generate complex wakes involving vortices (helical tip-vortex, root-vortex etc.).These wakes are regions of high velocity deficits and high turbulence intensities and they tend to degrade the performance of down-stream turbines. Hence, a conservative inter-turbine distance of up-to 10 times turbine diameter (10D) is sometimes used in wind-farm layout (particularly in cases of flat terrain). This ensures that wake-effects will not reduce the overall wind-farm performance, but this leads to larger land footprint for establishing a wind-farm. In-case of complex-terrain, within a short distance (say 10D) itself, the nearby terrain can rise in altitude and be high enough to influence the wake dynamics. This wake-terrain interaction can happen either (a) indirectly, through an interaction of wake (both near tip vortex and far wake large-scale vortex) with terrain induced turbulence (especially, smaller eddies generated by small ridges within the terrain) or (b) directly, by obstructing the wake-region partially or fully in its flow-path. Hence, enhanced understanding of wake- development due to wake-terrain interaction will help in wind farm design. To this end the current study involves: (1) understanding the numerics for successful simulation of vortices, (2) understanding fundamental vortex-terrain interaction mechanism through studies devoted to interaction of a single vortex with different terrains, (3) relating influence of vortex-terrain interactions to performance of a wind-farm by studying a multi-turbine wind-farm layout under different terrains. The results on interaction of terrain and vortex has shown a much faster decay of vortex for complex terrain compared to a flatter-terrain. The potential reasons identified explaining the observation are (a) formation of secondary vortices in flow and its interaction with the primary vortex and (b) enhanced vorticity diffusion due to increased terrain-induced turbulence. The implications of this vortex-terrain interactions on wind-farm performance is observed by comparing two LES simulations of a multi-turbine wind-farm layout (in real actual complex terrain and a made-up flat terrain scenario) with the observed annual power data at the actual wind-farm. The comparison reveals drop in power production due to terrain and wake effects for flatter terrain case. The insights from this study can serve as a step towards enhancing wake-dissipation through either artificial obstruction or artificial terrain modifications.},

The key idea is to represent both the exact and the numerical solution by the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators that they induce on the coupling hypersurface in the exterior of an obstacle. The investigation of convergence can then be related to a spectral analysis of these DtN operators. We give a general outline of our method and then proceed to a detailed investigation of the case that the coupling surface is a sphere. Our main goal is to explore the convergence mechanism. In this context, we show well-posedness of both the continuous and the discrete models. We further show that the discrete inf-sup constants have a positive lower bound that does not depend on the number of DOF of the IEM. The proofs are based on lemmas on the spectra of the continuous and the discrete DtN operators, where the spectral characterization of the discrete DtN operator is given as a conjecture from numerical experiments. In our convergence analysis, we show algebraic (in terms of N ) convergence of arbitrary order and generalize this result to exponential convergence.},

This paper also presents a comprehensive review of the strategic issues relating to the decommissioning process and of scheduling models that have been applied to offshore wind farms. A mathematical model using integer linear programming is developed to determine the optimal schedule considering several constraints such as the availability of vessels and planning delays. As the decommissioning problem is challenging to solve, a matheuristic approach based on the hybridisation of a heuristic approach and an exact method is also proposed to find near optimal solutions for a test set of problems. A set of computational experiments has been carried out to assess the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {In this work, the problem of a mufﬂer with internal extended inlet/outlet tubes is studied with the aim to optimize its geometric design. When boundary element method (BEM) based on the conventional boundary integral equation (CBIE) is used for structures with thin walls (internal extended tubes of small thickness), it produces nearly singular integrals which require smaller elements and higher number of Gauss quadrature points to maintain sufﬁcient accuracy of the overall solution. An alternative approach, known as mixed or dual BEM, which consists of neglecting the tube thickness, models the wall as a single surface and prescribes BIEs of different types on each side. However, this alternative leads to some discrepancies in the obtained results compared to other numerical or experimental data especially at higher frequencies. Another approach in this work is to utilize Burton-Miller method (BM) prescribing a combination of two types of BIEs on the original thin-walled geometry. BM is introduced in the framework of isogeometric analysis (IGA) to solve the mufﬂer problem as an interior 3D Helmholtz acoustic problem producing more accurate results. In addition, the isogeometric BM (IGA-BM) model beneﬁts from the BEM philosophy of reducing the dimensionality of a 3D problem to consider only its surfaces/boundaries. Moreover, producing the 4-pole parameters of the transmission loss (TL) entering/exiting the inlet/outlet tubes is convenient in the framework of BEM, which easily predicts the physical variables on the problem boundary.},

Developments of isogeometric boundary elements so far have focused on the direct BEM. Yet, a multitude of common problems in acoustics involves open-boundary surfaces, which require a more involved, indirect, boundary element formulation. The current work presents an indirect variational BEM which makes use of NURBS shape functions. Additionally, a novel technique for coupling (strongly) non-conforming patches is introduced to allow the analysis of more complex geometries. The proposed isogeometric indirect boundary element method is verified against analytical solutions and benchmarked against the conventional polynomial-based indirect BEM. Also two open-boundary problems are studied, including analyses over wider frequency ranges, and one industrial-type, complex geometry containing multiple non-conforming patches. The proposed method is found to be not only significantly more efficient than its polynomial-based counterpart, but also very robust against strong non-conformities in the NURBS descriptions.},

	abstract = {The concept of isogeometric analysis, whereby the parametric functions that are used to describe CAD geometry are also used to approximate the unknown ﬁelds in a numerical discretisation, has progressed rapidly in recent years. This paper advances the ﬁeld further by outlining an isogeometric boundary element Method (IGABEM) that only requires a representation of the geometry of the domain for analysis, ﬁtting neatly with the boundary representation provided completely by CAD. The method circumvents the requirement to generate a boundary mesh representing a signiﬁcant step in reducing the gap between engineering design and analysis. The current paper focuses on implementation details of 2D IGABEM for elastostatic analysis with particular attention paid towards the differences over conventional boundary element implementations. Examples of MatlabÒ code are given whenever possible to aid understanding of the techniques used.},

	abstract = {A study of structural shape optimization and absorbing material distribution optimization of noise barrier structures based on the recently proposed isogeometric analysis method with exact geometric definitions is presented. The acoustic scattering is approximated using the basis functions that represent the geometry. A fast multipole method is applied to accelerate the solution of the boundary element method (BEM). The Burton–Miller formulation is used to overcome the fictitious frequency problem when a single Helmholtz boundary integral equation is used for the exterior boundary–value problem. The strongly singular integrals in the Burton–Miller formulation using the isogeometric BEM are evaluated explicitly and directly, particularly for the sensitivity formulation with a hyper-singular integral. The optimality criteria method is used for two types of optimization analyses, shape optimization and material distribution topology optimization. For the shape optimization, the design variables can be set to the locations of the control points because the control points determine the shape of structure. For the second optimization, a new material interpolation scheme for acoustic problems based on the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method is given, where the interpolation variable is not the real structural density used in a conventional SIMP, but a fictitious material density that determines the normalized surface admittance. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

	abstract = {In this article, a black-box higher-order fast multipole method for solving boundary integral equations on parametric surfaces in three spatial dimensions is proposed. Such piecewise smooth surfaces are the topic of recent studies in isogeometric analysis. Due to the exact surface representation, the rate of convergence of higher-order methods is not limited by approximation errors of the surface. An element-wise clustering strategy yields a balanced cluster tree and an efﬁcient numerical integration scheme for the underlying Galerkin method. By performing the interpolation for the fast multipole method directly on the reference domain, the cost complexity in the polynomial degree is reduced by one order. This gain is independent of the application of either H- or H2-matrices. In fact, several simpliﬁcations in the construction of H2-matrices are pointed out, which are a by-product of the surface representation. Extensive numerical examples are provided in order to quantify and qualify the proposed method. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we put forth an evolve-then-correct reduced order modeling approach that combines intrusive and nonintrusive models to take hidden physical processes into account. Specifically, we split the underlying dynamics into known and unknown components. In the known part, we first utilize an intrusive Galerkin method projected on a set of basis functions obtained by proper orthogonal decomposition. We then present two variants of correction formula based on the assumption that the observed data are a manifestation of all relevant processes. The first method uses a standard least-squares regression with a quadratic approximation and requires solving a rank-deficient linear system, while the second approach employs a recurrent neural network emulator to account for the correction term. We further enhance our approach by using an orthonormality conforming basis interpolation approach on a Grassmannian manifold to address off-design conditions. The proposed framework is illustrated here with the application of two-dimensional co-rotating vortex simulations under modeling uncertainty. The results demonstrate highly accurate predictions underlining the effectiveness of the evolve-then-correct approach toward real-time simulations, where the full process model is not known a priori.},

This PML is based on using a nonintegrable absorbing function. “Exactness” must be understood in the sense that this technique allows exact recovering of the solution to time-harmonic scattering problems in unbounded domains. In spite of the singularity of the absorbing function, the coupled ﬂuid/PML problem is well posed when the solution is sought in an adequate weighted Sobolev space. The resulting weak formulation can be numerically solved by using standard ﬁnite elements. The high accuracy of this approach is numerically demonstrated as compared with a classical PML technique.},

	abstract = {In previous papers the authors presented new 3-D time-harmonic prolate and oblate spheroidal acoustic infinite elements, based on new prolate and oblate spheroidal multipole expansions, for modeling acoustic fields in unbounded domains. Here, we present the development of an ellipsoidal infinite element, which is the logical generalization of those elements. This development is also based on a new multipole expansion as well as a new system of ellipsoidal coordinates. The element stiffness, radiation-damping and mass matrices are developed and presented in sufficient detail to enable their software implementation. Both the new coordinate system and the new element include the previous spheroidal coordinate systems and spheroidal elements as limiting cases. Therefore, all the previously reported performance data for the spheroidal elements apply to this ellipsoidal element when used in spheroidal form. Since the three axes of an ellipsoid can be chosen independently, an ellipsoid can circumscribe any structural shape at least as closely, and generally more closely, than a prolate or oblate spheroid. The resulting reduction in size of the finite computational domain will result in even greater computational speeds than those already reported for the spheroidal elements. The element may be used to model problems in free-space (4'lT steradians), half-space (2'1T), quarter-space ('TT) or eighth-space ('TT/2). Since this infinite element provides maximum computational efficiency for structures of all shapes, software element libraries would need only this one element for all problems in unbounded domains. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

The conventional set of expansion functions used to approximate the dynamic pressure ﬁeld is extended with special purpose functions that incorporate the singular behaviour in the region around the singular corners. This enrichment comes with a beneﬁcial convergence rate while only a small increase of computational effort is incurred. This is illustrated for various problem settings, including different combinations of both homogeneous and non-homogeneous boundary conditions and bounded as well as unbounded problems are considered.},

	abstract = {This article addresses the efficient finite element solution of exterior acoustic problems with truncated computational domains surrounded by perfectly matched layers (PMLs). The PML is a popular nonreflecting technique that combines accuracy, computational efficiency, and geometric flexibility. Unfortunately, the effective implementation of the PML for convex domains of general shape is tricky because of the geometric parameters that are required to define the PML medium. In this work, a comprehensive implementation strategy is proposed. This approach, which we call the automatically matched layer (AML) implementation, is versatile and fully automatic for the end-user. With the AML approach, the mesh of the layer is extruded, the required geometric parameters are automatically obtained during the extrusion step, and the practical implementation relies on a simple modification of the Jacobian matrix in the elementwise integrals. The AML implementation is validated and compared with other implementation strategies using numerical benchmarks in two and three dimensions, considering computational domains with regular and nonregular boundaries. A three-dimensional application with a generally shaped domain generated using a convex hull is proposed to illustrate the interest of the AML approach for realistic industrial cases.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of virtual technology and data acquisition technology, digital twin (DT) technology was proposed and gradually become one of the key research directions of intelligent manufacturing. However, the research of DT for product life cycle management is still in the theoretical stage, the application framework and application methods are not clear, and the lack of referable application cases is also a problem. In this paper, the related research and application of DT technology are systematically studied. Then the concept and characteristics of DT are interpreted from both broad sense and narrow sense. On this basis, an application framework of DT for product lifecycle management is proposed. In physical space, the total-elements information perception technology of production is discussed in detail. In the information processing layer, three main function modules, including data storage, data processing and data mapping, are constructed. In virtual space, this paper describes the implementation process of full parametric virtual modeling and the construction idea for DT application subsystems. At last, a DT case of a welding production line is built and studied. Meanwhile, the implementation scheme, application process and effect of this case are detail described to provide reference for enterprises.},

	abstract = {We present an accurate method of O(1)-complexity with respect to frequency (i.e., a method that, to achieve a prescribed error tolerance, requires a bounded computational cost for arbitrarily high frequencies) for the computation of singular oscillatory integrals arising in the boundary integral formulation of problems of acoustic scattering by surfaces in three-dimensional space. Like the two-dimensional counterpart of this algorithm, which we introduced recently and which is applicable to scattering by curves in the plane, the present method is based on a combination of two main elements: (1) a high-frequency ansatz for the unknown density in a boundary integral formulation of the problem, and (2) an extension of the ideas of the method of stationary phase to allow for O(1) (high-order-accurate) integration of oscillatory functions. The techniques we introduce to implement an efﬁcient O(1) integrator in the present three-dimensional context differ signiﬁcantly from those used in the earlier two-dimensional algorithm. In particular, in the present text, we introduce an efﬁcient “canonical” (hybrid analytic-numerical) algorithm which, in addition to allowing for integration of oscillatory functions around both singular points and points of stationary phase, can handle the signiﬁcant difﬁculty that arises as singular points and one or more stationary points approach each other within the two-dimensional scattering surface. We include numerical results illustrating the behavior of the integration algorithm on sound-soft spheres with diameters of up to 5000 wavelengths: in such cases, for a single integral, the algorithm yields accuracies of the order of three digits in computational times of less than two seconds. In a preliminary full scattering simulation we present, a solution with two digits of accuracy in the surface density was obtained in about three hours running time, in a single 1.5 GHz AMD Athlon processor, for a sphere of 500 wavelengths in diameter.},

In this work a Reduced Order Model (ROM) of the incompressible flow around a circular cylinder, built performing a Galerkin projection of the governing equations onto a lower dimensional space is presented. The reduced basis space is generated using a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) approach. In particular the focus is into (i) the correct reproduction of the pressure field, that in case of the vortex shedding phenomenon, is of primary importance for the calculation of the drag and lift coefficients; (ii) for this purpose the projection of the Governing equations (momentum equation and Poisson equation for pressure) is performed onto different reduced basis space for velocity and pressure, respectively; (iii) all the relevant modifications necessary to adapt standard finite element POD-Galerkin methods to a finite volume framework are presented. The accuracy of the reduced order model is assessed against full order results.},

	abstract = {A solution strategy is proposed and implemented for taking advantage of the hierarchical structure of linear equation sets arising from the p-type finite element method using a hierarchical basis function set. The algorithm dynamically branches to either direct or iterative solution methods. In. the iterative solution branch, the substructure of the finite element equation set is used to generate a lower order preconditioner for a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method. The convergence rate of the PCG algorithm is monitored to improve the heuristics used in the choice of the preconditioner. The robustness and efficiency of the method are demonstrated on a variety of three dimensional examples utilizing both hexahedral and tetrahedral mesh discretizations. This strategy has been implemented in a p-version finite element code which has been used in an industrial environment for over two years to solve mechanical design problems.},

	abstract = {Two adaptive procedures of the h-p version for a high accuracy finite element analysis of two-dimensional elastic problems are studied. These are based on a strategy of first using an h-version to predict a nearly optimal mesh up to a certain accuracy and then following up with a p-version to achieve a higher accuracy. The h-version, using linear triangular elements, is developed by coupling a code, ADMESH, with an error estimation in energy norm. Following the h-version, two alternative procedures of non-uniform p-refinements are then performed. In procedure I, p-refinements are made in one step by selectively adding hierarchical shape functions of order p = 2 and 3 based on the estimated error in energy norm. In procedure II, p-refinements are made in a step-by-step way by which, in the kth step of the p-refinements, hierarchical shape functions of order p = k + 1 are selectively introduced. In the first step of p-refinements of procedure II, hierarchical variables are selected by means of the estimated errors in energy norm, whereas in the later steps, they are selected with a guidance of an error estimate which evaluates the local average error of stresses. The performances of both procedures and the rate of convergence are studied in numerical examples. Numerical tests for the error estimates being used are also made. Obtained results indicate that both procedures can achieve a high accuracy (say, error below 5\% measured in energy norm) in an exponential rate of convergence.},

	abstract = {An analysis for sound scattering by simple compound viscoelastic structures immersed in viscous ﬂuids is outlined. The dynamic viscoelastic properties of the scatterer and the viscosity of the surrounding ﬂuid are rigorously taken into account. The Havriliak–Negami model for viscoelastic material behaviour along with the appropriate wave-harmonic ﬁeld expansions and the pertinent boundary conditions are employed to develop a closed-form solution in form of an inﬁnite series. Subsequently, the associated acoustic ﬁeld quantities such as the scattered farﬁeld pressure and the form function amplitude are evaluated for given sets of viscoelastic material properties. Numerical results reveal that the scattered farﬁeld pressure directivity patterns are highly dependent on the coating thickness, especially for the low-damping polymeric coating at small and intermediate non-dimensional frequencies. At these frequencies, the high-damping polymeric coating leads to very uniform pressure patterns for essentially all coating thicknesses. Furthermore, numerical solution of the associated eigenfrequency equation conﬁrms that the comparatively high (moderate) scattered farﬁeld pressure amplitudes corresponding to the high-damping (low-damping) polymer at low and intermediate frequencies is due to the fact that the eigenfrequencies associated with the viscoelastic resonances predominantly fall inside this frequency range. Limiting cases are examined and fair agreements with well-known solutions are established.},

The effect of sound-absorbing materials on the acoustic response is characterized by acoustic impedance boundary conditions. The optimization problem is formulated in the framework of Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization methods and the sound absorption coefficients on elements are selected as design variables. The potential of the proposed topology optimization approach for engineering prototyping is illustrated by numerical examples.},

We recently reviewed (Refs 42, 43, 12) the cases dealing with acoustic resonance scattering from solid elastic bodies, or with elastic resonance scattering from fluid or solid inclusions in elastic media. It only remains for us to address the works dealing with submerged shells, which we analyze here. We study scattering by bare or viscoelastically coated spherical and cylindrical shells in water, by means of (exact) normal-mode solutions, and by spheroidal shells by numerical approaches, particularly via the T-matrix method. We consider the shell responses mostly in unbounded media and when the interrogating waves are plane and c.w., although some recent findings valid for pulsed incidences and in the vicinity of environmental boundaries are also included. We use the methodology of the resonance scattering theory (RST) as much as possible, emphasizing its post-1981 results. High-frequency findings, obtained by asymptotic methods, are extrapolated to lower frequencies, to confirm RST predictions for the intermediate spectral regions in which the most important structural resonances are known to reside. A large number of bibliographical entries are collected and discussed in connection with our approach.},

The new inﬁnite elements are geometrically constructed from a prolate spheroid inscribed by the scatterer. These elements need not begin on a level surface of the prolate spheroidal coordinate system. Instead, they may be attached to any convex surface, including that of the scatterer itself. This scheme reduces, or even completely eliminates, ﬁnite element modeling of the exterior medium. The formulations may easily be extended to the cases of an interior oblate spheroid or ellipsoid. We present both conjugated and unconjugated formulations without any weighting factors, although it would be simple to include them. We describe a fast numerical scheme for computing the element integrals based on Chebychev approximation. We include numerical results for scattering from spheres and capped cylinders. These results demonstrate the accuracy and the dramatic reduction in computational expense of our new formulations compared to other coupled ﬁnite element/inﬁnite element methods.},

Using T-splines, the computer aided design (CAD) and boundary element analysis are integrated without recourse to geometry cleanup or mesh generation. A regularized Burton–Miller formulation is used resulting in integrals which are at most weakly singular. We employ a collocation-based approach to generate the linear system of equations. The method is veriﬁed against closed-form solutions and direct comparisons are made with conventional Lagrangian discretizations. It is demonstrated that the superior accuracy of the isogeometric approach emanates from the exact geometric description encapsulated in the T-spline. The method is then applied to a real-world application to illustrate the potential for integrated engineering design and analysis.},

The present approach makes use of T-splines to discretise both the geometry and analysis ﬁelds allowing a direct integration of CAD and analysis technologies. A black-box fast multipole method of O(N) complexity is adopted that minimises refactoring of existing boundary element codes and facilitates the use of different kernels. This paper outlines an algorithm for implementing the open-source black-box fast multipole method BBFMM3D1 within an existing isogeometric boundary element solver, but the approach is general in nature and can be applied to any boundary element surface discretisation. The O(N) behaviour of the approach is validated and compared against a standard direct solver. Finally, the ability to model large models of arbitrary geometric complexity directly from CAD models is demonstrated for potential problems.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has significantly improved 2D image recognition. Extending into 3D may advance many new applications including autonomous vehicles, virtual and augmented reality, authoring 3D content, and even improving 2D recognition. However despite growing interest, 3D deep learning remains relatively underexplored. We believe that some of this disparity is due to the engineering challenges involved in 3D deep learning, such as efficiently processing heterogeneous data and reframing graphics operations to be differentiable. We address these challenges by introducing PyTorch3D, a library of modular, efficient, and differentiable operators for 3D deep learning. It includes a fast, modular differentiable renderer for meshes and point clouds, enabling analysis-by-synthesis approaches. Compared with other differentiable renderers, PyTorch3D is more modular and efficient, allowing users to more easily extend it while also gracefully scaling to large meshes and images. We compare the PyTorch3D operators and renderer with other implementations and demonstrate significant speed and memory improvements. We also use PyTorch3D to improve the state-of-the-art for unsupervised 3D mesh and point cloud prediction from 2D images on ShapeNet. PyTorch3D is open-source and we hope it will help accelerate research in 3D deep learning.},

The approach has similarity to the residual method but differs from it in the use of norms of negative Sobolev spaces corresponding to the given bilinear (energy) form. For clarity the presentation is restricted to one-dimensional model problems. More specifically, the source, eigenvalue, and parabolic problems are considered involving a linear, self-adjoint operator of the second order. Generalizations to more general one-dimensional problems are straightforward, and the results also extend to higher space dimensions; but this involves some additional considerations. The estimates can be used for a practical a-posteriori assessment of the accuracy of a computed finite element solution, and they provide a basis for the design of adaptive finite element solvers.},

	abstract = {The concept of isogeometric analysis, where functions that are used to describe geometry in CAD software are used to approximate the unknown ﬁelds in numerical simulations, has received great attention in recent years. The method has the potential to have profound impact on engineering design, since the task of meshing, which in some cases can add signiﬁcant overhead, has been circumvented. Much of the research effort has been focused on ﬁnite element implementations of the isogeometric concept, but at present, little has been seen on the application to the Boundary Element Method. The current paper proposes an Isogeometric Boundary Element Method (BEM), which we term IGABEM, applied to two-dimensional elastostatic problems using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). We ﬁnd it is a natural ﬁt with the isogeometric concept since both the NURBS approximation and BEM deal with quantities entirely on the boundary. The method is veriﬁed against analytical solutions where it is seen that superior accuracies are achieved over a conventional quadratic isoparametric BEM implementation.},

	abstract = {Long-term reliable health condition monitoring (HCM) of a wind turbine is an essential method to avoid catastrophic failure results. Existing unsupervised learning methods, such as auto-encoder (AE) and de-noising auto-encoder (DAE) models, are utilized to the condition monitoring of wind turbines. The critical bottleneck of these models for monitoring is to determine a threshold for identifying different health conditions. Unfortunately, the threshold is usually set up with different kinds of calculation methods or even based on experience. Therefore, the uncertainty of the threshold will inevitably influence the accuracy of the monitoring process and may lead to misdiagnoses. To overcome this limitation, this research introduces a threshold self-setting HCM scheme, based on deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) and employed for defining a self-setting threshold to monitor wind turbine generator bearings. A threshold for HCM can be automatically created through the output of the G network in the DCGAN model, and the challenging problem of setting up a threshold can be solved. Besides, the use of Nash Equilibrium for training enables this scheme to become self-defined evaluators with a high level of consistency, without any human intervention and can be treated as a self-defined threshold, and it is a model self-tuning process. Furthermore, a sample discrepancy analysis based on the output of the G network is utilized so that a quantitative indicator of the fault severity in wind turbine generator bearings are provided. By tracking a real wind turbine dataset from the LU NAN wind farm in China, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified.},

In order to analyze how DC techniques and its applications have evolved, a detailed survey on many existing DC techniques is carried out to address the current requirements in terms of data quality, coding schemes, type of data and applications. A comparative analysis is also performed to identify the contribution of reviewed techniques in terms of their characteristics, underlying concepts, experimental factors and limitations.

	abstract = {Manufacturing new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners represents a computational challenge to industry, due to the large variability in material parameters and geometrical configurations that need to be tested during the early design phase. This process can be highly optimised through the employment of user-friendly computational metamodels constructed on the basis of Reduced Order Modelling (ROM) techniques, where high-dimensional parametric offline solutions are obtained, stored and assimilated in order to be efficiently queried in real time. This paper presents a novel Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD) based metamodel for the analysis of electro-magneto-mechanical interactions in the context of MRI scanner design, with three distinct novelties. First, the paper derives, from scratch, a five-dimensional parametrised offline solution process, expressed in terms of (axisymmetric) cylindrical coordinates, external excitation frequency, electrical conductivity of the embedded shields and strength of the static magnetic field. Second, by exploiting the staggered nature of the coupled problem at hand, an efficient sequential PGD algorithm is derived and compared against a previously published monolithic PGD algorithm. As a third novelty, the paper draws some interesting comparisons against an alternative tailor-made ROM technique, where the electromagnetic equations are solved using a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition model. A series of numerical examples are presented in order to illustrate, motivate and demonstrate the validity and potential of the considered approach, especially in terms of cost reduction.},

	abstract = {We consider two-dimensional scattering problems, formulated as an integral equation deﬁned on the boundary of the scattering obstacle. The oscillatory nature of high-frequency scattering problems necessitates a large number of unknowns in classical boundary element methods. In addition, the corresponding discretization matrix of the integral equation is dense. We formulate a boundary element method with basis functions that incorporate the asymptotic behavior of the solution at high frequencies. The method exhibits the eﬀectiveness of asymptotic methods at high frequencies with only few unknowns, but retains accuracy for lower frequencies. New in our approach is that we combine this hybrid method with very eﬀective quadrature rules for oscillatory integrals. As a result, we obtain a sparse discretization matrix for the oscillatory problem. Moreover, numerical experiments indicate that the accuracy of the solution actually increases with increasing frequency. The sparse discretization applies to problems where the phase of the solution can be predicted a priori, for example in the case of smooth and convex scatterers.},

Although high-Reynolds, turbulent ﬂow has been a motivating factor, the present study is mainly restricted to the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. The proposed method is analyzed for properties like stability, accuracy and consistency, aided by some test examples. In addition, two diﬀerent ﬂow cases are simulated to evaluate the ability and eﬃciency of the method compared with other results.},

Benchmark and practical potential problems for two-dimensional and axisymmetric cases are considered. The formulation of the error estimate is based on a projection process of adjacent boundary element solutions. The error estimator is coupled with an h-refinement technique to predict a new mesh. A self-adaptive technique that requires minimal user interaction to activate the adaptive process and can be easily implemented into a standard boundary element code structure is proposed.},

	abstract = {In the present study, we investigate different data-driven parameterizations for large eddy simulation of two-dimensional turbulence in the a priori settings. These models utilize resolved flow field variables on the coarser grid to estimate the subgrid-scale stresses. We use data-driven closure models based on localized learning that employs a multilayer feedforward artificial neural network with point-to-point mapping and neighboring stencil data mapping, and convolutional neural network fed by data snapshots of the whole domain. The performance of these data-driven closure models is measured through a probability density function and is compared with the dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM). The quantitative performance is evaluated using the cross-correlation coefficient between the true and predicted stresses. We analyze different frameworks in terms of the amount of training data, selection of input and output features, their characteristics in modeling with accuracy, and training and deployment computational time. We also demonstrate computational gain that can be achieved using the intelligent eddy viscosity model that learns eddy viscosity computed by the DSM instead of subgrid-scale stresses. We detail the hyperparameters optimization of these models using the grid search algorithm.},

	abstract = {•A power-deficiency and risk-management (PDRM) model for micro-siting is proposed.•PDRM mitigates power deficiency risk under wind uncertainty and predicted demand.•PDRM provides decision alternatives through comprehensive risk analyses.•An effective Cyber Swarm Algorithm (CSA) is developed to obtain PDRM solutions.•CSA robustness is verified with convergence analysis and worst-case analysis. The usage of fossil fuels has caused severe damages to the natural environment. In the last decade, the renewable energy production is growing rapidly in major industry countries. As of 2014, wind power generation exceeded 4\% of total electricity demand worldwide. Classic wind farm micro-siting models aim to minimize the cost of energy (COE). However, the risk of the power deficiency could be high with these models because of the variations of wind conditions and electricity demands. This paper proposes a power-deficiency and risk-management (PDRM) model of micro-siting for mitigating the power deficiency risk under demand while still keeping the COE as effective as that obtained by classic planning models. Our PDRM model is able to provide risk analyses with alternative risk tolerance settings and power deficiency measures. The flexibility of the PDRM model is helpful for the decision makers to choose the most appropriate solution from our analyses based on their business value and applications. We further develop a Cyber Swarm Algorithm (CSA) to approximate the optimal solution of the PDRM model. The robustness of the CSA is verified with statistical methods including the convergence analysis and the worst-case analysis.},

Owing to the local nature of the process, the algorithm is perfectly suited to parallel implementation. The algorithm can be applied in both two and three dimensions for unstructured, k-irregular meshes and elements of non-uniform degree. Finally, it is shown that the implementation of the flux equilibration algorithm can take advantage of calculations already performed in obtaining the finite element approximation itself.},

	isbn = {978-0-19-166876-0},
	abstract = {Self-adaptive discretization methods are now an indispensable tool for the numerical solution of partial differential equations that arise from physical and technical applications. The aim is to obtain a numerical solution within a prescribed tolerance using a minimal amount of work. The main tools in achieving this goal are a posteriori error estimates which give global and local information on the error of the numerical solution and which can easily be computed from the given numerical solution and the data of the differential equation. This book reviews the most frequently used a posteriori error estimation techniques and applies them to a broad class of linear and nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations. Although there are various approaches to adaptivity and a posteriori error estimation, they are all based on a few common principles. The main aim of the book is to elaborate these basic principles and to give guidelines for developing adaptive schemes for new problems. Chapters 1 and 2 are quite elementary and present various error indicators and their use for mesh adaptation in the framework of a simple model problem. The basic principles are introduced using a minimal amount of notations and techniques providing a complete overview for the non-specialist. Chapters 4-6 on the other hand are more advanced and present a posteriori error estimates within a general framework using the technical tools collected in Chapter 3. Most sections close with a bibliographical remark which indicates the historical development and hints at further results.},

The chosen example of this equation concerns dielectric structures (or media) of electrostatics. The paper addresses hierarchical theories (also called hierarchical models) and hierarchical approximations. In the assessment of the models and approximations, our own and existing a priori error estimation results are applied. The used assessment procedure can be employed to any other applications of Laplace equation in applied sciences. The proposed theories (understood as mathematical formulations) and their numerical approximations are applied to the physical model of linear dielectricity in structures with complex electric description and complex geometry. We take advantage of the 3D and 3D-based theories, hierarchical modeling, and hierarchical approximations within hpq{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mi is="true"{\textgreater}h{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mi is="true"{\textgreater}p{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mi is="true"{\textgreater}q{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} finite element formulation. In our research, the applied theory and discretization parameters, i.e. the element size h{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mi is="true"{\textgreater}h{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}, the longitudinal approximation order p{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mi is="true"{\textgreater}p{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}, and the transverse order q{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mi is="true"{\textgreater}q{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}, differ in each finite element.
This is the second paper out of a series of papers devoted to model- and hpq-adaptive finite element methods assigned for the modeling and analysis of elastic structures of complex mechanical description. In our previous publication we investigated the issue of hierarchical models and approximations of such structures. We applied 3D or 3D-based mechanical models, hierarchical modeling, and hierarchical approximations within the proposed finite element formulation. Furthermore, we assumed that the mechanical model and discretization parameters (such as: the size h of the element, and the longitudinal and transverse approximation orders, p and q) could vary locally, i.e. they could be different in each finite element. The a posteriori error estimation discussed in the present paper is based on the generalization of the residual equilibration method on the models with internal constraints. The generalized method is applied to the assessment of the total and approximation errors, while the modeling error is calculated as the difference between the former two errors. The corresponding error-controlled adaptive procedures are based on a three-step strategy, with possible iterations of h- and p-steps.
This is a paper out of a series of three papers devoted to model- and hpq-adaptive finite element methods assigned for modeling and analysis of complex structures. In this paper we focus our attention on hierarchical models and hierarchical approximations, while the issues of error estimation and adaptivity control will be presented in the next papers of the series. In all the papers we consider the elastic structures of complex mechanical description. We apply 3D or 3D-based mechanical models, hierarchical modeling, and hierarchical approximations within our finite element formulation. In the proposed approach, the mechanical model and discretization parameters, such as the size h of the element, and the longitudinal and transverse approximation orders, p and q, can vary locally, i.e. they can be different in each finite element. The a posteriori error estimation is based on the residual equilibration methods applied to the assessment of the modeling and approximation errors. The error-controlled adaptive procedures are derived from a four-step strategy, with possible iterations on h- and p-steps.
A method to obtain a posteriori an accurate measure of the error in finite element computations is to solve a Neumann problem with equilibrated tractions for each finite element. We extend this approach to large-strain elasticity and mixed finite elements, which are well suited for nearly incompressible rubber-like materials. For an L2-projection of the error in the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor we prove that the estimator provides a guaranteed upper bound without multiplicative constants. Numerical examples confirm the effectiveness for both linear and Ogden material.
This paper presents a study of two types of a posteriori error estimator based on equilibrium defaults in finite element solutions of planar linear elastic problems. The G{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mtext{\textgreater}G{\textless}/mtext{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}-type estimator, developed at LTAS-Inforgraphie, uses explicit relations between the equilibrium defaults and the energy of the error. This type is represented here with a new physical interpretation, and with the reference tractions on the sides of elements redefined so as to satisfy equilibrium. The δ-type estimator uses a reference solution for stress δ, which has no equilibrium defaults, i.e. δ is a statically admissible stress field. The reference solutions considered in this paper are based on the formulation first proposed by Ladeveze. This present study considers several alternative formulations of equilibrating tractions suitable for both types of estimator, and its is restricted to errors in models composed of 4-noded bilinear Lagrange elements. Numerical results are presented for several examples with smooth or singular stress fields. It is observed that significant improvements to the effectiveness of the G{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mtext{\textgreater}G{\textless}/mtext{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}-estimator can be obtained, particularly for coarser meshes. With judicious choice of equilibrating tractions it is concluded that this estimator can be more effective than the δ-estimator.
This paper presents an a posteriori error estimator and hp-adaptive strategy for the Helmholtz equation in exterior domains. These technologies are integral components of solution adaptive finite element analyses, with application to, e.g., time-harmonic exterior acoustics problems. The error estimator is an explicit function of residuals (no local problems need to be solved), and is in the form of an upper bound on the global L2-norm of the error. A posteriori error bounds are derived for two finite element discretizations: the Galerkin and Galerkin least-squares (GLS) formulation. The hp-adaptive strategy converts the estimated error distribution, which is extracted from the global error norm, into a distribution of element size h and polynomial order p for the subsequent adaptive mesh. The principle of equidistribution of element error is used to guide the \{h, p\} distribution, leading to an efficient adaptive mesh. The adaptive strategy is a simple algorithm which computes pointwise values of h and p, and allows for simultaneous refinement of both. In addition, the adaptive strategy does not require knowledge of the global scaling constant appearing in the error estimator, which greatly simplifies the computation.},

We introduce a phase-ﬁeld approximation to the Lagrangian for discrete fracture problems and derive the coupled system of equations that govern the motion of the body and evolution of the phase-ﬁeld. We study the behavior of the model in one dimension and show how it inﬂuences material properties. For the temporal discretization of the equations of motion, we present both a monolithic and staggered time integration scheme. We study the behavior of the dynamic model by performing a number of two and three dimensional numerical experiments. We also introduce a local adaptive reﬁnement strategy and study its performance in the context of locally reﬁned T-splines. We show that the combination of the phase-ﬁeld model and local adaptive reﬁnement provides an effective method for simulating fracture in three dimensions.},

Toward emerging applications of digital twins in aviation, the proposed approach allows for constructing a realtime predictive tool for wake-vortex transport and decay systems. We build on the fact that in realistic application, there are uncertainties in initial and boundary conditions, model parameters, as well as measurements. Moreover, conventional nonlinear ROMs based on Galerkin projection (GROMs) suffer from imperfection and solution instabilities, especially for advection-dominated flows with slow decay in the Kolmogorov n-width. In the presented LSTM nudging (LSTM-N) approach, we fuse forecasts from a combination of imperfect GROM and uncertain state estimates, with sparse Eulerian sensor measurements to provide more reliable predictions in a dynamical data assimilation framework. We illustrate our concept by solving the two-dimensional vorticity transport equation. We investigate the effects of measurements noise and state estimate uncertainty on the performance of the LSTM-N behavior. We also demonstrate that it can sufficiently handle different levels of temporal and spatial measurement sparsity, and offer a huge potential in developing next-generation digital twin technologies for aerospace applications.},

	abstract = {Aluminum electrolysis cells are characterized by harsh environments where several measurements have to be done manually. Due to the operational costs related to manual sampling, the sampling rates of these measurements are low. Therefore, the information in the data can be limited, making it challenging to develop robust data-driven methods for aluminum electrolysis process. A broad array of physics-based models have been developed throughout the years to provide excellent system knowledge about the dynamics in the aluminum electrolysis cells. However, due to highly complex and interrelated sub-processes, the state-of-the-art physics-based models are insufficient to accurately express the dynamics in the cell. The combination of inadequate prediction models and low sampling rates makes estimating process variables in the aluminum electrolysis process less accurate than what is desired for optimal and safe operation of the cells. In this paper, a novel hybrid modeling approach that addresses insufficient prediction models and low sampling rates is suggested. The novel hybrid modeling approach involves manipulating a measured signal with a first principle model estimate. This manipulation, which consists of subtracting the first principle model estimate from the measurements of the signal, produces a residual that represents the unmodeled dynamics in the signal. Since the unmodeled dynamics of the measured signal is much sparser than the measured signal itself, this manipulation enables utilizing a powerful technique for estimating sparse signals from only a few measurements. The technique is called compressed sensing. The manipulated data is used as input data in a compressed sensing algorithm which produces a high fidelity estimate of the unmodeled dynamics in the original signal. Thus, the novelty in this article is two-fold. First, compressed sensing is introduced to the field of aluminum electrolysis. Second, the novel technique of sparsifying a measured signal with a first principle model in order to utilize compressed sensing on the measured data is introduced. The signal estimate of the unmodeled dynamics is integrated into an Extended Kalman filter as a pseudo measurement to improve the estimation of the system states. The novel method applies to signals with stationary periodical unmodeled dynamics. The case study in this article is conducted on simulated data of a sub-process describing the mass balance in an aluminum electrolysis cell.},

	abstract = {This work presents a hybrid modeling approach to data-driven learning and representation of unknown physical processes and closure parameterizations. These hybrid models are suitable for situations where the mechanistic description of dynamics of some variables is unknown, but reasonably accurate observational data can be obtained for the evolution of the state of the system. In this work, we propose machine learning to account for missing physics and then data assimilation to correct the prediction. In particular, we devise an effective methodology based on a recurrent neural network to model the unknown dynamics. A long short-term memory (LSTM) based correction term is added to the predictive model in order to take into account hidden physics. Since LSTM introduces a black-box approach for the unknown part of the model, we investigate whether the proposed hybrid neural-physical model can be further corrected through a sequential data assimilation step. We apply this framework to the weakly nonlinear Lorenz model that displays quasiperiodic oscillations, the highly nonlinear chaotic Lorenz model, and two-scale Lorenz model. The hybrid neural-physics model yields accurate results for the weakly nonlinear Lorenz model with the predicted state close to the true Lorenz model trajectory. For the highly nonlinear Lorenz model and the two-scale Lorenz model, the hybrid neural-physics model deviates from the true state due to the accumulation of prediction error from one time step to the next time step. The ensemble Kalman filter approach takes into account the prediction error and updates the diverged prediction using available observations in order to provide a more accurate state estimate for the highly nonlinear chaotic Lorenz model and two-scale Lorenz system. The successful synergistic integration of neural network and data assimilation for low-dimensional system shows the potential benefits of the proposed hybrid-neural physics model for complex dynamical systems.},

	abstract = {Background modeling and subtraction is a core component in motion detection and analysis, using a stationary camera. This paper proposes a new technique for background modeling and subtraction capable of processing a real-time video and achieving high detection rates. Color information alone can't handle dynamic environments. On the other hand, edge or texture information alone is not sufficient for uniform regions. To overcome these limitations, the proposed technique integrates Local Binary Pattern (LBP) texture feature, RGB color feature and Sobel edge feature, using “Choquet” fuzzy integral to avoid the uncertainty in the classification. This is performed by extracting the color and the edge gray scale confidence maps and introducing the texture confidence map. Then, a single median filtering and a connected components algorithms are applied to remove the noise and label the connected regions. Experimental results for both indoor and outdoor dataset sequences confirmed the robustness and the effectiveness of the proposed technique against illumination variation and scene motion.},

	abstract = {Optimization is an art that is best performed by a well-tuned algorithm. Nature – instead of being fully deterministic – is evolutionary, vibrant and resourceful. The nature-inspired algorithms use the best combination and evolution strategy in a given situation. In this work, a new metaheuristic algorithm is developed by using social behavior in human dynasties. The motivation, conceptual framework, mathematical model, pseudocode and working of the algorithm are described in this paper and the adjoining papers. The proposed dynastic optimization algorithm (DOA) has evolved with the wind turbine micrositing (WTM) problem in mind. The proposed DOA has been successfully applied to the traditional WTM and encouraging results have been obtained. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach is equally viable as other existing algorithms, like the Genetic algorithm (GA) and Differential evolution algorithm (DEA). The main advantage of the proposed DOA is that it is simple, unique, fast, unbiased and versatile in comparison with others. The validation of results has been made with respect to a few other mainstream algorithms in the literature, besides statistical sensitivity analysis is also performed. The 95\% confidence interval forecasts for the power enhancement and cost reduction by using DOA against GA and DEA are encouraging and guarantee an adequate amount of mean increase in power output and a considerable average cost reduction. The proposed metaheuristic optimization algorithm is inspired from human dynasties. Full application is made to the Wind Turbine Micrositing (WTM) problem. The mathematics, pseudocode, working, advantages and application are discussed. The DOA reveals superior results as compared to the GA and DEA. 95\% confidence bounds indicate that future forecasts are encouraging.},

Compared with the weakly-singular form of the HBIE published earlier [Y.J. Liu and F.J. Rizzo, A weakly-singular form of the hypersingular boundary integral equation applied to 3-D acoustic wave problems, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 96 (1992) 271–287], this new form involves only tangential derivatives of the density function and thus its discretization using the boundary element method (BEM) is easier to perform. Instead of using nonconforming and C1 continuous boundary elements advocated earlier, C0 continuous (conforming quadratic) elements are employed in the discretization of this weakly-singular form of the HBIE. Some justifications on using C0 elements for HBIEs are provided to reflect the current views on this crucial issue for HBIEs. It is postulated that the original C1,α continuity requirement for the density function in the analytical HBIE formulation can be relaxed to piecewise C1,α continuity in the numerical implementation of the weakly-singular forms of the HBIE. Numerical examples of both scattering and radiation problems clearly demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of the new weakly-singular form of the HBIE for 3-D acoustics.},

However, these techniques involve a high number of approximation functions. In the finite element framework, widely used in complex flow simulations, each approximation function is related to a node that defines the associated degree of freedom. When the model involves high dimensional spaces (including physical and conformation spaces and time), standard discretization techniques fail due to an excessive computation time required to perform accurate numerical simulations. One appealing strategy that allows circumventing this limitation is based on the use of reduced approximation basis within an adaptive procedure making use of an efficient separation of variables.},

The current work involves development of a multiscale methodology for obtaining wind fields in an urban landscape. The multi-scale methodology involves coupling three models operating on different scales namely an operational meso-scale numerical weather prediction model HARMONIE, a micro-scale model that captures terrain- induced wind influence and a super-micro scale Computational Fluid Dynamics model using large eddy simulation and RANS model to capture the building-induced wind flow. Here, we present a comparison of the wind velocity predicted by two different turbulence models (LES and RANS) that are operating at the finest scale with the measured experiment data for a realistic case of flow in vicinity of the Oslo university hospital.

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce an uplifted reduced order modeling (UROM) approach through the integration of standard projection based methods with long short-term memory (LSTM) embedding. Our approach has three modeling layers or components. In the first layer, we utilize an intrusive projection approach to model the dynamics represented by the largest modes. The second layer consists of an LSTM model to account for residuals beyond this truncation. This closure layer refers to the process of including the residual effect of the discarded modes into the dynamics of the largest scales. However, the feasibility of generating a low rank approximation tails off for higher Kolmogorov n-width systems due to the underlying nonlinear processes. The third uplifting layer, called super-resolution, addresses this limited representation issue by expanding the span into a larger number of modes utilizing the versatility of LSTM. Therefore, our model integrates a physics-based projection model with a memory embedded LSTM closure and an LSTM based super-resolution model. In several applications, we exploit the use of Grassmann manifold to construct UROM for unseen conditions. We perform numerical experiments by using the Burgers and Navier–Stokes equations with quadratic nonlinearity. Our results show the robustness of the proposed approach in building reduced order models for parameterized systems and confirm the improved trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.},

In our hybrid-modeling framework, we combine physics-based projection methods with neural network closures to account for truncated modes. We introduce a weighting parameter between the Galerkin projection and extreme learning machine models and explore its effectiveness, accuracy and generalizability. To illustrate the success of the proposed modeling paradigm, we predict both the mean flow pattern and the time series response of a single-layer quasi-geostrophic ocean model, which is a simplified prototype for wind-driven general circulation models. We demonstrate that our approach yields significant improvements over both the standard Galerkin projection and fully non-intrusive neural network methods with a negligible computational overhead.},

	abstract = {Numerical solution of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations poses a significant computational challenge due to the solenoidal velocity field constraint. In most computational modeling frameworks, this divergence-free constraint requires the solution of a Poisson equation at every step of the underlying time integration algorithm, which constitutes the major component of the computational expense. In this study, we propose a hybrid analytics procedure combining a data-driven approach with a physics-based simulation technique to accelerate the computation of incompressible flows. In our approach, proper orthogonal basis functions are generated to be used in solving the Poisson equation in a reduced order space. Since the time integration of the advection–diffusion equation part of the physics-based model is computationally inexpensive in a typical incompressible flow solver, it is retained in the full order space to represent the dynamics more accurately. Encoder and decoder interface conditions are provided by incorporating the elliptic constraint along with the data exchange between the full order and reduced order spaces. We investigate the feasibility of the proposed method by solving the Taylor–Green vortex decaying problem, and it is found that a remarkable speed-up can be achieved while retaining a similar accuracy with respect to the full order model.},

The conditions take a recursive form with increasing order of accuracy. In three dimensions the recursion terminates and the resulting conditions are exact for solutions which are described by finite combinations of angular spherical harmonics. First we develop the expansion for the twodimensional wave equation and construct a sequence of easily implementable boundary conditions. We show that in three dimensions the analogous conditions are again easily implementable in addition to being exact. Also, we provide extensions of these ideas to hyperbolic systems. Namely, Maxwell's equations for TM waves are used to demonstrate the construction. Finally, we provide numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of these conditions for a model problem governed by the wave equation. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. and IMACS.

	abstract = {This paper presents a hybrid finite-element/boundary-element method for fluid–structure-interaction simulations of inflatable structures. The flow model consists of the steady Stokes equation, which admits a boundary-integral formulation. The structure is represented by a Kirchhoff–Love shell. The boundary-element approximation of the Stokes equation reduces the flow problem to an integral equation on the actual structure configuration, thus obviating the need for volumetric meshing of the strongly deforming fluid domain. The Stokes model moreover exhibits a lubrication effect that acts as an intrinsic mechanism to treat the ubiquitous self-contact that occurs in inflation problems. The aggregated fluid–structure-interaction problem, composed of the boundaryintegral equation and the Kirchhoff–Love shell connected by dynamic and kinematic interface conditions, is approximated by means of isogeometric discretizations to accommodate the smoothness requirements on the approximation spaces imposed by the flexural rigidity in the Kirchhoff–Love shell and to provide an accurate and smooth representation of the boundary for the boundary-element method. Auxiliary results presented in this paper are: (1) a parametrization-free Kirchhoff–Love formulation; (2) establishment of a cubic relationship between distance and tractions due to the lubrication effect; and (3) the interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier pertaining to fluid incompressibility as the total excess pressure.},

This approach provides a great deal of ﬂexibility in dealing with the geometry of the scatterer and the ﬂuid–ﬂuid interface. The high level of accuracy achievable with the PML is established with standard validation problems for scattering in a homogeneous ﬂuid. The model is also applied to the problem of acoustic scattering from objects situated near the ocean ﬂoor, where the ocean bottom is modeled acoustically as a ﬂuid. Numerical results show very close agreement with a published T-matrix solution for the same problem.},

	abstract = {Summary This work proposes a novel finite volume paradigm, ie, the face-centred finite volume (FCFV) method. Contrary to the popular vertex and cell-centred finite volume methods, the novel FCFV defines the solution on the mesh faces (edges in two dimensions) to construct locally conservative numerical schemes. The idea of the FCFV method stems from a hybridisable discontinuous Galerkin formulation with constant degree of approximation, and thus inheriting the convergence properties of the classical hybridisable discontinuous Galerkin. The resulting FCFV features a global problem in terms of a piecewise constant function defined on the faces of the mesh. The solution and its gradient in each element are then recovered by solving a set of independent element-by-element problems. The mathematical formulation of FCFV for Poisson and Stokes equation is derived, and numerical evidence of optimal convergence in two dimensions and three dimensions is provided. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed methodology. The results show that, contrary to other finite volume methods, the accuracy of the FCFV method is not sensitive to mesh distortion and stretching. In addition, the FCFV method shows its better performance, accuracy, and robustness using simplicial elements, facilitating its application to problems involving complex geometries in three dimensions.},

	abstract = {Wind turbine condition monitoring (WTCM) plays an important role in reducing operation \& maintenance (O\&M) cost and improving the reliability of wind farms. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data have advantages such as easy access and strong timeliness and are used widely for WTCM. However, it is difficult to distinguish and label historical SCADA data as healthy or faulty accurately during the model training process. Therefore, a De-ambiguous Condition Monitoring scheme with Transfer layer (DCMT) based on SCADA data is proposed to overcome this problem. This scheme provides a fault early warning for wind turbines. In this scheme, an improved auto-encoder (AE) network with a transfer layer is designed to eliminate the effect of SCADA data in the ambiguous status (ambiguous data) and enhance the reliability of a training dataset. Meanwhile, a structure of Siamese encoder is designed to calculate the residuals between latent features, i.e., the outputs of the Siamese encoders. These residuals can be utilised to identify wind turbine operational conditions. Further, least squares generative adversarial networks (LSGAN) is introduced to learn the distribution of health data while restricting the discriminator and realising the augmentation of health data for model training. The proposed method is applied to two cases of generator winding and gearbox bearing over-temperature faults of wind turbines from northwest China. Compared with other methods, the proposed method effectively detects potential abnormal conditions in advance without raising false alarms.},

The infinite elements are of variable order in the radial direction and differ only in whether the test functions in the weak formulation are conjugated or not. We find that the accuracy of the ABCs decreases with increasing frequency, and that at higher frequencies their accuracy is several orders of magnitude lower than that obtained with the IEMs. We show that the convergence rate of the conjugated element is slower than the rate for the unconjugated element and that the latter element fails to converge in the far field. 01998 Elsevier Science S.A.

	abstract = {In this chapter, installation of offshore wind farms is discussed briefly. The installation of offshore wind farms is discussed in four categories corresponding to four main wind farm elements, which are foundations, turbines, substations and cables. For the installation of each category, specialised equipment, vessels and installation methods are necessary. Furthermore, preinstallation activities, such as onshore assembly and offshore transportation, and post-installation activities, such as tests and commissioning are discussed. Precommissioning tests are mandatory to demonstrate proper functionality of turbines and the wind farm as a whole. If all tests are successful, the wind farm can be commissioned and be connected to a grid. In the last section of this chapter, a conclusion is given and innovative offshore installation solutions are described.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to estimating the continuous six degree of freedom (6-DoF) pose (3D translation and rotation) of an object from a single RGB image. The approach combines semantic keypoints predicted by a convolutional network (convnet) with a deformable shape model. Unlike prior work, we are agnostic to whether the object is textured or textureless, as the convnet learns the optimal representation from the available training image data. Furthermore, the approach can be applied to instance- and class-based pose recovery. Empirically, we show that the proposed approach can accurately recover the 6-DoF object pose for both instance- and class-based scenarios with a cluttered background. For class-based object pose estimation, state-of-the-art accuracy is shown on the large-scale PASCAL3D+ dataset.},

	abstract = {We propose a scalable, efficient and accurate approach to retrieve 3D models for objects in the wild. Our contribution is twofold. We first present a 3D pose estimation approach for object categories which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on Pascal3D+. Second, we use the estimated pose as a prior to retrieve 3D models which accurately represent the geometry of objects in RGB images. For this purpose, we render depth images from 3D models under our predicted pose and match learned image descriptors of RGB images against those of rendered depth images using a CNN-based multi-view metric learning approach. In this way, we are the first to report quantitative results for 3D model retrieval on Pascal3D+, where our method chooses the same models as human annotators for 50\% of the validation images on average. In addition, we show that our method, which was trained purely on Pascal3D+, retrieves rich and accurate 3D models from ShapeNet given RGB images of objects in the wild.},

	abstract = {The capability of boundary element methods (BEM) for solving three-dimensional time harmonic Helmholtz acoustic scattering problems is presented in the framework of the isogeometric analysis (IGA). Both the CAD geometry and the physical boundary variables are approximated using Non-uniform Rational B-splines basis functions (NURBS) in an isogeometric setting. A detailed comparison between two BEM methods: the conventional boundary integral equation (CBIE) and Burton–Miller (BM) is provided including the computational cost. The proposed models are enhanced with a modified collocation scheme with offsets to Greville abscissae to avoid placing collocation points at the corners. Placing collocation points on a smooth surface enables accurate evaluation of normals for BM formulation in addition to straightforward prediction of jump-terms and avoids singularities in O(1/r ) integrals eliminating the need for polar integration. Furthermore, no additional special treatment is required for the hyper-singular integral while collocating on highly distorted elements, such as those containing sphere poles. Acoustic shape optimization in different mediums (air and water) is performed with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the results are compared with the benchmark solutions from the literature. The reference solutions are obtained with BM which deals with higher order singularities and gradient-based optimization, and requires more complicated sensitivity analysis. The obtained results indicate that, CBIE with PSO is a feasible alternative (except for a small number of fictitious frequencies) which is easier to implement.},

	abstract = {Understanding 3D object structure from a single image is an important but challenging task in computer vision, mostly due to the lack of 3D object annotations to real images. Previous research tackled this problem by either searching for a 3D shape that best explains 2D annotations, or training purely on synthetic data with ground truth 3D information. In this work, we propose 3D INterpreter Networks (3D-INN), an end-to-end trainable framework that sequentially estimates 2D keypoint heatmaps and 3D object skeletons and poses. Our system learns from both 2D-annotated real images and synthetic 3D data. This is made possible mainly by two technical innovations. First, heatmaps of 2D keypoints serve as an intermediate representation to connect real and synthetic data. 3D-INN is trained on real images to estimate 2D keypoint heatmaps from an input image; it then predicts 3D object structure from heatmaps using knowledge learned from synthetic 3D shapes. By doing so, 3D-INN benefits from the variation and abundance of synthetic 3D objects, without suffering from the domain difference between real and synthesized images, often due to imperfect rendering. Second, we propose a Projection Layer, mapping estimated 3D structure back to 2D. During training, it ensures 3D-INN to predict 3D structure whose projection is consistent with the 2D annotations to real images. Experiments show that the proposed system performs well on both 2D keypoint estimation and 3D structure recovery. We also demonstrate that the recovered 3D information has wide vision applications, such as image retrieval.},

	abstract = {We explore 3D human pose estimation from a single RGB image. While many approaches try to directly predict 3D pose from image measurements, we explore a simple architecture that reasons through intermediate 2D pose predictions. Our approach is based on two key observations (1) Deep neural nets have revolutionized 2D pose estimation, producing accurate 2D predictions even for poses with self occlusions. (2) Big-data sets of 3D mocap data are now readily available, making it tempting to lift predicted 2D poses to 3D through simple memorization (e.g., nearest neighbors). The resulting architecture is trivial to implement with off-the-shelf 2D pose estimation systems and 3D mocap libraries. Importantly, we demonstrate that such methods outperform almost all state-of-the-art 3D pose estimation systems, most of which directly try to regress 3D pose from 2D measurements.},

	abstract = {The Hundred Years' War (French: La guerre de Cent Ans; Picard: Dgère d'Un Chint Ans; 1337–1453) was a series of armed conflicts between the kingdoms of England and France during the Late Middle Ages. It originated from disputed claims to the French throne between the English House of Plantagenet and the French royal House of Valois. Over time, the war grew into a broader power struggle involving factions from across Western Europe, fuelled by emerging nationalism on both sides.
The Hundred Years' War was one of the most significant conflicts of the Middle Ages. For 116 years, interrupted by several truces, five generations of kings from two rival dynasties fought for the throne of the dominant kingdom in Western Europe. The war's effect on European history was lasting. Both sides produced innovations in military technology and tactics, including professional standing armies and artillery, that permanently changed warfare in Europe; chivalry, which had reached its height during the conflict, subsequently declined. Stronger national identities took root in both countries, which became more centralised and gradually rose as global powers.The term "Hundred Years' War" was adopted by later historians as a historiographical periodisation to encompass related conflicts, constructing the longest military conflict in European history. The war is commonly divided into three phases separated by truces: the Edwardian War (1337–1360), the Caroline War (1369–1389), and the Lancastrian War (1415–1453). Each side drew many allies into the conflict, with English forces initially prevailing. The House of Valois ultimately retained control over France, with the previously intertwined French and English monarchies thereafter remaining separate.},
